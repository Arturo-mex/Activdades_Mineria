2436,France,"With the amalgamation of Château Magdelaine into this one property, the estate is now a considerable 58 acres. The wine is now performing in top gear.

2444,France,"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time.

This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate.

7691,Spain,"Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer.

8079,France,"From the cool east face of the vineyard, this is crisp and tight, less opulent than some Corton-Charlemagne.

8282,US,"From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry.

8445,France,"While this wine comes out of the gate showing little but earth and dark fruit aromas, it lightens and develops more delineation with air, eventually revealing berry, plum and spice notes.

Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest.

10509,Australia,"This is dark and concentrated, as you might expect from Australia's most heralded wine. Oaky scents of maple syrup and vanilla frame hints of mint and superintense dark fruit.

The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade.

10519,US,"As with previous vintages, this rare wine spent 38 months in barrel.

10538,Spain,"Luscious prune and blackberry aromas come with complex notes of graphite, toast and tobacco. The palate on this 80-case, high-end Tinto Fino is about as full as they come while still maintaining impeccable balance.

10539,US,"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022.

10553,US,"This bottling is the winery's most expensive wine, and usually its best. Production of the '08 was unusually low, resulting in amazing concentration. It's basically a detonation of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and mocha. New oak is present, in the form of delicate toast and wood spice, but is balanced. So silky and delicious now, you can drink it, but the tannic balance suggests the cellar. Will evolve over the next 12 years, maybe longer.",Bien Nacido Vineyard X Block The Good Nacido,94,100.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Qupé

10594,Portugal,"This wine is dominated by Touriga Nacional, which offers a backbone of dark tannins that gives it a firm structure and will allow it to age for many years. Produced in open stone lagares, it has richness and impressive opulence in black fruit tones that are cut by juicy acidity. Drink from 2022.",,97,100.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vale Meão
10595,Spain,"Gorgeous from head to toe, this saturated Toro heavyweight sets a new bar for this winery and the region as a whole. Ribald blackberry aromas are toasty and carry a strong note of crushed stones. Cassis, black plum and blackberry flavors are complex and inspired, while the finish tastes of chocolaty oak, blackened toast and a black-fruit potpourri supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink from 2017–2030.",Alabaster,97,227.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
10596,France,"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035.",Brand Grand Cru,96,100.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
10597,US,"A single-barrel reserve, this wine is compact and concentrated—a perfectly melded blend of fruit, barrel and acidity. It's a refined, beautifully polished wine, with just a touch of butterscotch wrapped into the finish. Drink now through 2030.

10598,Spain,"Lightly rusty in color, this outstanding gran reserva is just now entering its golden years, which should endure for another two decades or so. Aromas of raisin, malt, tobacco and cedar are beautiful. This is tight and sinewy in feel, with rooty, creamy, classic Rioja flavors of vanilla, tobacco and dried red fruits. A lasting, stout finish isn't breaking down at all; drink through 2040.",Gran Reserva 890,96,125.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,La Rioja Alta
10600,Spain,"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032.",Tinus,96,351.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
10602,Australia,"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length. Drink 2020–2030, and likely then some.",Amery Vineyard Block 6,96,120.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Kay Brothers
10604,Portugal,"This is an astonishing wine for its age. It shines with fruit and with rich toffee flavors that are balanced by acidity. It's a warm, ripe wine, intense and concentrated. The dryness of such a long wood aging (the wine was only bottled in 2015) is really only a background to the richness.",Colheita Tawny,96,415.0,Port,,,Port,Burmester
10606,France,"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.",Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru,96,120.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
10607,South Africa,"One of the finest selections from South Africa today, Sadie's 2011 Columella is structured, complex and masterfully balanced, ready for a beautiful, long life ahead. The bouquet leads with lovely scents of rooibos tea, minty fynbos and African violets that frame the ripe boysenberry, blackberry and plum fruit spine. Layers of lush black fruit and earthy spice dance on the velvety palate, with peppery tannins that hang on to the lingering finish alongside hints of cocoa powder, licorice root and star anise.

10613,Portugal,"Bottled in 2015, this wine from a great Port vintage is dark in color and so concentrated. It is powered by intense acidity from the wood aging as much as any residual fruit. Spice, dried fruits and a perfect balance give this great wine elegance and surprising freshness. Drink now.",Colheita Tawny,95,220.0,Port,,,Port,Kopke
10651,Austria,"Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own. The warming resonance on the palate suggests it has a long future. Drink from 2019.",Ried Loibenberg Smaragd,94,1100.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Emmerich Knoll
10657,US,"Roasted coffee aromas are inviting on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon, blessed with 25% Cabernet Franc. The marriage works on every level, providing structured tannins and a leathery afterthought around vibrant accents of blackberry and dark plum.

10770,US,"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020.",HaLo,95,175.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen
10771,Australia,"The fruit for this offering comes from the Green's and Crowhurst vineyards. This wine brings a a sense of cellarworthiness, from the inky color and dense, impenetrable bouquet to the richly tannic palate and long, plushly textured finish. Right now, it delivers hints of toast and mint, blueberry and plum fruit and savory notes of roasted meat and mocha. Drink 2018–2025+.",R Reserve,95,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
10778,Germany,"So lusciously ripe, with notes of mango and guava, this is an explosion of sweet fruit, honey and flowers.

10781,Germany,"Aromas of mango and candied-orange rind lend a heady tropical feel to this concentrated TBA full of peach and marmalade flavors.

10800,Argentina,"This is a potent brew with complexities galore, but there's also a simplicity about it that's appealing. Its raw size is bracing, but the structure and fabric of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon scream balance. Aromas of lead pencil, sawdust, coconut and brandied cherries introduce briary dark-berry flavors.

10803,Spain,"The last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic. Flavors of cassis, black cherry and dark plum operate off a mocha base, while the finish is toasty and chocolaty, with a note of black coffee.

10805,US,"The “X” designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness—buried so deeply now—but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time.",Limited Release X Clones Estate,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
10809,Portugal,"Fermented in open stone lagars, this fine wine has a very rich character. It has a concentrated feel, smoothly ripe and very dense.

10860,Portugal,"There is a great balance between acidity and impressively fresh fruit considering the age of this venerable Port. Of course there are many flavors from the wood aging, but they are combined with orange marmalade, fig and raisin flavors in a riot of complex flavors that have created a very great wine. It comes from a year that was not generally declared as a vintage.",Colheita Tawny,95,375.0,Port,,,Port,Kopke
10864,France,"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent.

Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.",Ashmead Single Vineyard,89,108.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elderton
13244,Spain,"This is more brown than burnished gold in color, while it smells of toffee, brandy and maple syrup. Salty caramel and peanut flavors finish like a peanut butter cookie bathed in salt.

13897,Spain,"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point.

It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal.

14572,Germany,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar.

14573,US,"So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot.

14575,US,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",Obsidian,97,120.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Arkenstone
14577,Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering.

14578,France,"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper.

14579,US,"This dramatic, compulsively good Cabernet is the first Howell Mountain Cab ever from the winery. It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control.

14790,US,"So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor. The blackberry and cassis flavors have an edge of chocolate, and the deliciousness is compounded by superbly ripe, sculpted tannins and a long but thoroughly dryfinish.

Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying.

A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it.

14802,US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak.

14805,US,"The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it.

14812,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't.

14970,US,"This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding.

14989,France,"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout.

14994,US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
15034,US,"Tannins and acids currently dominate, giving this dry, young wine a bit of a lockdown quality. The winemaker, Michael Trujillo, aims at a more structured style, and he has achieved it here.

15318,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

15324,Australia,"A tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries.

Drink now and over the next 4–5 years.",Australian Old Vine Collection,90,100.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,Gibson's BarossaVale
15420,US,"Another huge '99. It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish. There is a core of blackberry fruit that is solid and dense, the result of very low yields. This pricy wine is not drinkable now, unless you're not fussy. If you buy it, plan on aging for at least five years.",Reserve,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harrison
15435,US,"Showcases the shortcomings of the vintage as well as the strengths of its terroir and winemaking.

15436,US,"Richer and more complete than the '98 La Joie, with which it was simultaneously released.

15589,US,"This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice.

15863,Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas.

16211,US,"This Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is the most inaccessible of Merryvale's '07 portfolio, and it consequently offers the least pleasure now. It's quite rich in blackberries and currants but the tannins are considerable, and 90% new oak buries the fruit under a cloak of char and wood tannins.

17416,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better.

18617,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins.

18620,US,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years.

18621,Portugal,"Old-gold in color, this wine has concentrated flavors with an almost medicinal intensity. Old wood and acidity form a dominant element along with a note of orange peel. A memorable wine for savoring.",30 Years Old Tawny,96,200.0,Port,,,Port,Niepoort
18627,US,"A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.",,95,170.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming
18661,Portugal,"Dark in color, this is a powerful, classic wine, with dense tannins. It has rich black-fruit flavors, and notes of wood and herb that are packed into its concentrated, dry structure. This is a great Douro for aging.",Batuta,95,100.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Niepoort
18664,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Memento,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
18665,US,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.",Generations,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
18670,Italy,"Villa Gemma is a flagship wine for Abruzzo that underlines a specific quality-minded winemaking philosophy that makes this Italian region so exciting and full of surprises. The wine is dark and superconcentrated, with amazing intensity and generous layers of mature berry fruit, spice, tobacco, used leather and polished river stone. It is smooth, firm, dense and will age many more years to come.",Villa Gemma,94,100.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,Masciarelli
18673,Portugal,"Now that the color of this superb wine has gone to old gold, it has definitely become a gloriously mature Port. The color translates into sweetness, which is allied to acidity, richness and an immense intensity due to its long wood aging.",Colheita,94,100.0,Port,,,Port,Niepoort
18674,US,"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine. Should begin to throw sediment and mellow in seven or eight years, and could go the distance to 2020 and beyond.",,94,150.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Notre Vin
18677,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc shows all the charms of the 2007 vintage. It's an opulent, delicious wine, immediately likeable now for its broad array of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins are soft, but strong enough to protect this wine for the next six years at the very least.",Elivette,94,125.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Spring Mountain Vineyard
18724,US,"From Frank Family, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend was grown in Rutherford. It's marked by intense flavors of blackberry, black cherry and currant, wrapped into firm, ripe tannins, and aged in 75% new French oak barrels. A perfect wine for drinking now with a great steak.",,93,150.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Winston Hill
18787,US,"Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew. Drink soon, before it loses freshness.",Contrarian,93,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards
18789,Chile,"Opaque in color, with a driving bouquet loaded with graphite, pastry and incredibly ripe black-fruit aromas. Feels rich, but with fine acidity creating superb balance. Tastes like a cascade of blackberry, cassis and chocolate, and then comes a finish of coconut, vanilla and texture. Drink now through 2014; contains 9% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Gravas del Maipo,93,150.0,Buin,,,Syrah,Concha y Toro
18802,US,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager. Cellar until 2017.",,92,150.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Notre Vin
18848,US,"This is a big, rich, vibrant wine, fruity enough to drink now. Mainly Merlot, with some Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's deliciously forward in cherry, currant, herb and new oak flavors. The vineyard is in the cooler Oak Knoll District, and the wine shows a brisk acidity that makes it elegant and refined.",Illustration,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards
18865,US,"Hard tannins currently lock this wine down. Although it's astringent, it's very polished and complex. Made from Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, it's marked by black cherry, red currant and cedar flavors, and finishes totally dry. The vineyard is in the cool Oak Knoll District, which helps explain the acidity and tightness. Difficult to predict if it will age.",Paramour,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards
19221,Portugal,"A smooth and beautifully ripe wine that is full of rich red fruits, in a Burgundian style. Opulent and deliciously rich, its tannins are enveloped in a plump velvet cushion. It can age longer, but is almost drinkable now.",Charme,90,100.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Niepoort
19355,Australia,"Not a Cellar Selection in the traditional sense of requiring additional aging, this venerable wine (it contains some material over 100 years old) is ready to drink now, but should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown, with delectable aromas of rancio, pressed flowers, molasses and honey, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. Amazingly complex and fresh on the neverending finish.",Rare,100,300.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
19357,US,"Depth and texture dominate; it's all whole-cluster fruit, aged in new barriques. This fine follow-up to the 2006 features a little more delicacy, with a lovely floral component and some earth. The depth is astonishing in the weight and texture and the way the wine plays out across the palate. The finish never ends: a glorious mix of black cherry, earth, herb, spice, and rock.",Royal City Stoneridge Vineyard,99,140.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Charles Smith
19361,US,"This initially tastes like young fruit, herbal, with a lot of stem and flower flavors, but with some heat at 16% alcohol. Nonetheless it's delicious, compact, enormously fruity, focused and flat out amazing. A perfect mix of flesh, fruit, earth, and typicity from this unique vineyard.",Heart Stoneridge Vineyard,98,120.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Charles Smith
19362,US,"This is the best of the winery's new releases, both for drinking now and for cellaring. Combines power and elegance, with upscale flavors of cherries, currants, cola, rhubarbs, dried herbs and oak, wrapped into devastatingly rich tannins and a perfect touch of acidity. Should age well for 10 years.",Litton Estate Vineyard,98,100.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
19364,Australia,"Incredibly concentrated and intense, this dark coffee-colored wine coats the glass and the palate with waves of luxuriously sweet, raisiny flavors. Layers of complexity follow in the form of rancio, dried fig and molasses, with a citrusy edge providing life and freshness to the nearly endless finish.",Rare Muscadelle,97,300.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscadel,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
19365,US,"Killer juice. It has it all—focus, depth, detail and power. Spice and herb, punch and power, wrapped into a wine with bright, tight berry fruit and layer upon layer of earth, rock and herb. It surpasses the ability of language to describe it. But it needs time—a lot of time.",Skull Stonebridge Vineyard,97,120.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Charles Smith
19369,US,"This displays extraordinary fruit flavors, along with a dense, deep minerality. The flavors seamlessly blend berry, rock, graphite, fresh herb, and light barrel notes. But the fruit! Ripe and rich and aggressively full bodied. Berries piled upon earth and rock, and the flavors linger forever.",Old Bones Stoneridge Vineyard,96,140.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Charles Smith
19372,France,"Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer.",Le Méal Ermitage,95,270.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
19376,US,"Shows the Bacchus profile of ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, pure, strong tannins and exceptional balance. It's a dry, classically structured Cabernet of enormous complexity and interest. So delicious now, it's tempting to drink, but it's way too young. This is a wine to cellar, and it should blossom over the next 20 years.",Backus Vineyard,95,250.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
19378,Australia,"Thick, dark brown and looking as much like molasses as wine, Buller's Calliope Rare Tokay has a soy-like meatiness to it, a leathery note that adds complexity to its notes of treacle and rancio. Almost too sweet and syrupy, with an endless finish.",Calliope Rare,95,120.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Tokay,R.L. Buller & Son
19443,Australia,"The Grand level of Chambers' offerings may be the best compromise between expense, rarity and quality.

19447,Italy,"Gorgeous, rich and penetrating, this wine excels in terms of the elegance of its aromas. Layers of black fruit, spice, mesquite, beef jerky, cola and soy sauce are perfectly integrated and the wine shows plump, ripe richness on the close. Promises to age 10 years or more.",Riserva Sergio Zenato,95,130.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Zenato
19450,US,"This lush wine epitomizes the modern Napa style of soft richness and extreme drinkability when young. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, it's beautiful now for its blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. For all its approachability, it should age well for the next six to eight years.",Red Wine,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Viader
19457,France,"The 2006 L'Ermite boasts a wonderfully fragrant bouquet of cracked pepper, beef blood and plummy fruit, but is a full-bodied, powerful expression of Syrah on the mouth, bulging with crushed stone and espresso nuances. It's velvety without being soft, the tannins showing supple strength. Drink 2015–2030.",L'Ermite Ermitage,94,345.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
19458,US,"You have to count this as another great Insignia, dry and complex and ageworthy, although the tannins are fierce now, and it may lack just a bit of the glamor of, say, the 2004 or 2001. It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013. Production was a hefty 13,500 cases.",Insignia,94,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps

19502,Italy,"Mazzano is a very special expression of Amarone with seamless integration and persistency.

19508,France,"Le Pavillon is drawn from Les Bessards, the most granitic of Hermitage's climats, resulting in a wine with pronounced structure and minerailty. Hints of cinnamon and clove join plum and crushed stone on the nose, while the concentrated flavors suggest iron or beef blood as well.

19519,Italy,"Bosan is a beautiful Amarone with gorgeous intensity and personality.

19520,Australia,"Coffee-brown in color, with a hint of golden-yellow at the rim, Chambers Grand Muscadelle features intense aromas of caramelized walnuts and a pronounced rancio character, all tied together by molassesy sweetness. Viscous and wildly concentrated, it leaves a lasting impression on glassware and palate alike.",Grand Muscadelle,93,140.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscadel,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
19522,US,"A great, elegant Cabernet to drink now and for the next four years or so. It's soft in acids and satiny in tannins, with extraordinarily delicious blackberry- and cherry-pie filling, anise liqueur, cassis, cola and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Gets better as it breathes in the glass.",Réserve Spéciale,93,110.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
19619,US,"With 15.4% alcohol by volume, this is arguably Lail's ripest, hottest Cabernet ever. It certainly has flashy blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, but there's a raisin-and-prune, overripe finish. Could age, but it's more likely that the heat will pinch in within six years, crushing the fruit.",J. Daniel Cuvée,88,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lail
19679,US,"Very rich and ripe, but compromised by a mouthfeel that's simultaneously soft and yet weirdly acidic, like it has a squeeze of lime juice.

19693,Italy,"This is a lovely Amarone with loads of intensity and personality that runs straight through the thick and succulent character of its fruit.

Already approachable, it should continue to drink well through at least 2020.",Les Greffieux Ermitage,92,205.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
19706,Italy,"Because Masi releases its Campolongo di Torbe cru expression of Amarone many years later than the competition, the wine has had time to develop its tertiary aromas of sweet spice, polished stone, licorice, rum cake and candied fruit.

19721,Canada,"An unusual Merlot icewine, this is clear and quite lovely in the glass, with shades of sunset orange and mahogany, like burnished wood. It's unctuous and sugary in the mouth, with grainy flavors of sugarcane, strawberry jam and sweet cherry liqueur. Quite thick for an icewine, with a cloying finish.",Journey of Hope Icewine,88,145.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,,Merlot,Ex Nihilo
19829,US,"Lush and smooth, this is a Cabernet to drink now for its fantastic depth and captivating deliciousness. It's dry and tannic, with major flavors of blackberries, blueberries, currants and cassis, framed in smoky oak.

19946,Italy,"This is a focused, pristine Amarone that ends with firm tannins and a velvety mouthfeel. It is redolent of red cherry, coffee, road pavement, leather and licorice.

20057,Spain,"Intriguing but expensive sweet wine, with leather and dried cheese aromas as well as dusty, rubbery black fruits and licorice. It's not that unusual or exciting in terms of mouthfeel, but the flavors of cassis liqueur, stewed cherry and black licorice are tight and powerful. Structured to last another decade, with meaty tannins and molasses on the finish.",Dolç de l'Obac,90,128.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana

20301,US,"Tight when first opened, with polished fruit flavors of blackberry and cassis, mingling with barrel accents of anise and clove. The alcohol, listed at 13.5%, does not indicate the weight and power of the wine.

20360,US,"The 2006 vintage of this Cabernet blew me away. This '07 is considerably more difficult to evaluate. Fresh out of the bottle, it's dry, tannic and raw in acids. The black cherry sour candy and Dr. Pepper cola flavors have an unrelieved toughness. Yet the balance seems to be there for aging. The score is entirely tentative, and could well rise in coming years. But it could also go down. Roll the dice.",Estate,90,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sabina Vineyards
20369,Chile,"A massive, sweet and hugely ripe style of Carmenère that leans toward fat and raisiny, even buttery.

20826,US,"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor.

21177,US,"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price.

21501,US,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a worthy followup to the extraordinary 2006 and 2007 vintages. Feels fine in the mouth, with rich tannins and dry, elegant flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and French oak. The tannins are pure Napa, smooth and complex. Not ready to drink now, but give it a good six years, and it could develop over the next fifteen.",Alexander,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Volker Eisele Family Estate
21543,Australia,"Duval used to make Grange, so it is no surprise that his current luxury Shiraz is so successful. The 2008 Eligo oozes with oaky sweetness—vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar notes—but balances that with potent cassis fruit and somehow ends on dry, savory notes of tobacco and spice. Drink now-2018, although it could surprise and go longer.",Eligo,94,100.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,John Duval Wines

21546,France,"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood.

21555,Hungary,"Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.",Essencia,94,764.0,Tokaji,,,Furmint,Royal Tokaji

It should drink well for at least a decade.",RWT,93,150.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Penfolds
21668,France,"While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it.

21669,France,"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous.

21974,Spain,"Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment.

22110,US,"This is a big, age-worthy 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Tasted now, it's dryly tannic, with the black currant and crème de cassis flavors buried under a cloak of astringency. New oak, which comprises 80% of the barrels, adds even greater tannins.

Although it's tight in tannins and acidity, it's extraordinarily rich in blueberry, blackberry, chocolate and roasted almond flavors, like a granola bar.

22285,US,"At the age of more than four years, this 100% Cabernet remains an immature clash of fruit, oak and tannins. Everything sticks out, especially the massive blackberry and cassis flavors. The oak is sweet and butterscotchy on the finish. With a superb structure, it seems like an ideal cellar candidate, except for a touch of bitter raisin in the finish. Hard to predict its future.

22301,Italy,"From the distant 1994 vintage, this Vin Santo blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia has been aged an astonishing 15 years in small oak barrel.

There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Provençal herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time.

22787,US,"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",,90,195.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,M by Michael Mondavi
22844,US,"The new oak sticks out like a sore thumb, dominating this young wine with vanilla, buttered toast and charred wood aromas and flavors. Fortunately, the underlying wine also is very powerful in ripe blackberry and cherry fruit. This is an elegant, strong, impressive Cabernet, but the oak should be reined in to allow the beautiful fruit to star.",Walther River Block,90,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,D.R. Stephens
22898,Argentina,"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.",Noemía,90,108.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
22913,US,"Feels rather heavy and extracted right now, with masses of jammy cherries, currants, chocolate and spices, and even a note on the finish of overripe raisins. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a filigree of toast and vanilla. Made from 100% Merlot, it's a good, rich red wine, but would have benefited with the addition of a little Cabernet Sauvignon or Petit Verdot for complexity.",Reserve,89,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Jarvis
23006,Spain,"A nutty and acidic wine, with aromas of pressed walnuts and toffee. Feels tight, sharp and narrow on the tongue, with blazing acidity and dry, limited, salty flavors that fold in toffee and sour fruit notes.

23440,US,"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to find. Vanilla, char, buttered toast and woody aromas and flavors dominate and contribute to the tannins. The underlying Cabernet seems quite lovely, and it's an elegant, refined wine for drinking now. You have to wonder, though, why they plastered it under so much new oak.",Moose Valley Vineyard,87,125.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,D.R. Stephens

23764,US,"In keeping with the voluptuous approachability of the 2007 vintage, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is simply fabulous now for its flood of the ripest, sweetest blackberrries, cherries, cassis and chocolate imaginable. Especially noble is the tannin structure, firm and soft, dry and sweet, a combination of opposites. The depth is vast, and the spicy finish goes on for a long time, suggesting the wine's concentration. Simply a joy to drink, it should develop over many years, but you might want to err on the side of youthfulness and open it by 2015.",Hillside Select,97,225.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer

It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined.

It is beautifully balanced, with a bone-dry character, just softened by the toastiness that is developing. Expect this to age for many years.",Dom Pérignon Oenothèque Brut,99,385.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
26298,France,"A glorious Champagne, now at the peak of its powers and maturity. It is rich, creamy, lightly toasty, cookies and yeast propelling the fruits and acidity forward into a wonderful texture. This wine confirms Henriot's place at the top tables of Champagne.",Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut,98,170.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Henriot
26299,France,"Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more.",RD Brut Champagne,97,260.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
26300,France,"Exceptionally rich and dense, an exceptional wine that reveals itself in layers, from the first fruit attack to the mineral texture and the way it gradually fills the mouth. Selected from old vines, there is a great flavor in this wine, with the promise of many years' aging.",Cristal Brut,97,229.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer
26303,France,"With all the extreme intensity of this vintage, this wine brings even more. The start of cookie yeast and toast character, a vibrant mineral texture, hints of spice, green herbs and a final white peach flavor. It is still young, just keep aging.",Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut,97,185.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Henriot
26304,Italy,"Bravo! The Brunate cru has awarded Vietti with a stellar product: a wine that is unusually dark and plush with impressive intensity and crafted aromas of black fruit, spice, earth, licorice, balsam and gianduia chocolate-hazelnut spread. The soft, velvety texture is seductively delicious and the wine will age many long, glorious years.",Brunate,97,130.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
26307,France,"Intensely Chardonnay, this beautiful wine, named after the ancient rulers of Champagne, is pure mineral, green and citrus fruits, a steely shaft of pure concentration. Now just with a light touch of toast, this still will mature for several years.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs,96,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
26308,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",,96,175.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin
26340,France,"Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex. This is a wonderful expression of taut minerality, pure citrus zest and then a wood-toast character that gives the wine both richness and sophistication. Given the fresh, intense fruit, this will certainly age for many years.",Brut,96,350.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
26341,Italy,"It's hard to beat the quality achieved by this spectacular wine. Luciano Sandrone's Barolo from the Cannubi Boschis cru is creamy, rich, opulent and sophisticated. It oozes flavors of espresso, ripe cherry, cassis, cola and licorice. In the mouth, it is extraordinarily bright and generous and the seamless finish can be counted in long minutes. And, the best news is: this wine will only improve with time.",Cannubi Boschis,96,150.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
26345,France,"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast. While 2000 is not a vintage for aging, this opulent Champagne may be the exception.",La Grand Année Brut,95,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
26347,France,"As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity. It is a wine that is also a Champagne, now in full flow of mineral richness, still with a long way to develop.",Cuvée Femme Brut,95,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy
26358,Italy,"Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more.",Rocche,95,130.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
26361,France,"A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity. It is crisp, definitely on the dry side, with red currants, bright wild strawberries over the purest acidity. It's sure to age over many years, but, if you must, can be drunk now.",Grand Siècle Alexandra Brut Rosé,95,390.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
26362,France,"Now at its peak of maturity, this is a gorgeous toast and spice flavored Champagne. It has richness, refined acidity, a powerful concentration of yeasty almonds, a taut texture and a final flavor that is straight, true, perfectly balanced.",Dom Ruinart Brut,95,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Ruinart
26365,Italy,"From a simpatico, family-run winery comes this benchmark Barolo. La Serra speaks highly of the Langhe territory and of winemaking innovation. Aromas here include cherry cola, vanilla bean, leather and crushed granite stone. The wine is determined and direct with a savory note of cured meat on the long finish. Drink after 2017.",La Serra,95,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Eugenio Bocchino
26367,Italy,"Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more.",Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche,95,252.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Ceretto
26403,France,"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",Brut Rosé,94,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
26404,France,"With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity. With its complex poise between lightness and richness, this remains an intensely impressive wine.",Grande Cuvée Brut,94,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
26412,US,"Such are the tannins in this 100% Cab that it demands cellar time. It's really shut down and astringent in youth, which emphasizes the dryness. But it's very fine, with a solid core of ripe black cherry fruit that will express its sweetness when the tannins melt away. Winemaker Amy Aiken is really showing her stuff with this polished ager. Best 2013–2019.",Morisoli Vineyard,94,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meander
26416,Italy,"Nei Cannubi from Poderi Einaudi is textbook Barolo; the kind of wine you can bank on for an elegant and enlightening drinking experience. You see that, here, all the elements are perfectly in place and stacked for maximum pleasure. Aromas of blue flower, berry and shaved mineral build in intensity and the wine is determined and persistent on the palate.",Nei Cannubi,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
26427,Italy,"Barolo La Serra from Gianni Voerzio would make a perfect companion to pulled pork smoked over hardwood charcoal. There's a sassy spice element here backed by plush layers of blueberry, blackberry and plum. The tannins are still on the young, astringent side; give this wine some time to unwind in the cellar.",La Serra,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Voerzio
26428,Italy,"Barolo Ornato is a beautiful wine: rich in flavor, intensity and personality. You can taste the quality of the fruit here thanks to the pristine notes of cherry, wild berry, spice and ginger that emerge from the nose. Oak notes of vanilla and cinnamon are nicely integrated and folded within the wine's dense, supple texture.",Ornato,94,109.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare
26461,US,"A beautiful, rich, elegant, fancy sparkling wine. Feels so fine in the mouth, all silk and satin, with deep, dry raspberry, strawberry, vanilla, toast, yeasty lees, brioche and honey flavors. Superb, but young. Needs time. Give it until 2011, if you can keep your hands off, and should develop until 2015, if not longer.",J. Schram,94,100.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
26468,US,"Erupts out from the glass with beautiful Cabernet perfume, suggesting cherry pie from the oven, licorice, sandalwood and dusty dried herbs, like sage and thyme. Very dry, with a long spicy finish, but also quite tannic, although lots of the tannins come from new oak. Best to age this polished 100% Cab for at least six years.",Reserve,94,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
26478,US,"This is a very rich wine. Complex, too. With every sip, it seems to offer a little more of itself. On the surface, it's dry, tannic and fruity, with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. But it has mineral and herb nuances that seem to spring from the soil, and the depth and finish are impressive. Drinkable now for sheer luxury, and should continue to develop over the next decade.",Dancing Bear Ranch,94,105.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cakebread
26481,Italy,"A Barolo superstar on the rise—keep a close watch on the wines of Gianni Gagliardo and family. This expression from the prized Cannubi cru offers impressive intensity and personality with enticing aromas of black fruit, cola, root beer, cured beef, cedar and white truffle. The wine is ethereal and elegant but the tannic touch is firm enough to promise a long cellar future ahead.",Cannubi,94,125.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Gagliardo
26482,France,"Dominated by rich Pinot Noir, this is still impressively youthful. It has a sense of power and concentration, with intense white fruit, yeast and just a hint of honey. It could age, but is ready to drink.",Celebris Vintage Extra Brut,94,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
26487,France,"This famed single vineyard on its steep slope above Mareuil-sur-Aÿ produces a warm, always elegant wine. This 1999 is softer than some vintages, while still having a power and texture to go with fruit that is now maturing, giving a yeasty final character. Drink now, or age another few years.",Clos des Goisses Brut,94,200.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
26520,Italy,"From the celebrated Bricco Asili cru, this Barbaresco is a beautiful embodiment of elegance, grace, harmony and complexity. Fine aromas of small berry fruit, violets, cola, dark spice and fresh licorice root peel off layer after layer. The wine shows excellent structure, with tight, firm tannins and a bright touch of acidity on the long finish.",Bricco Asili Bricco Asili,93,154.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ceretto
26534,Italy,"Barolo Colonnello is a determined, confident wine with a rich, succulent style and ripe aromas of blackberry, spice, sweet vanilla and polished black stone. The chewy mouthfeel also shows a precise stylistic choice and “the colonel” is richly opulent and enduring on the finish.",Colonnello,93,175.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Aldo Conterno
26547,US,"Dark, bold, potent and young are just a few words to describe this Cabernet, which contains a splash of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant and violet flavors that turn sweet and chocolaty on the finish, although the wine itself is perfectly dry. Quite tannic, which suggests ageability, although high alcohol of 15.5% will be controversial in some circles. Best after 2013, in a proper cellar.",Georges de Latour Private Reserve,93,115.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
26583,Italy,"The quality and persistency of the fruit is impressive. This Riserva Barolo is extremely generous in terms of its cherry, blackberry, cola and exotic spice aromas. The wine sports fine texture and smooth flavors of plum and leather on the close.",Vigna Rionda Riserva,93,134.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Massolino
26590,Italy,"This edition of the prized Cerequio Barolo by Michele Chiarlo flaunts its own unique personality with immediate aromas of white cherry, red apple, tar, licorice powder and root beer. It's a polished, squeaky- clean wine with a long finish that seems more buoyant and vertical compared to past vintages.",Cerequio,93,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Michele Chiarlo
26596,Italy,"Le Vigne is an evolved and elegant wine with dark fruit backed by smoke, spice and toasted nut. It's a full, ripe, plump and linear wine with a dense, succulent close and sophisticated accents of mineral and cola on the long, long finish. Overall, this Barolo is beautiful and special.",Le Vigne,93,155.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
26610,France,"A gloriously rich rosé that is full of ripe raspberries that burst in the mouth. It has a tight texture, balanced by a rounded feel. It is still young, of course, and the sweet finish needs time to integrate. Even so, relish the wine now, or wait 3–4 years.",Comtes de Champagne Rosé Brut,93,290.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Taittinger
26614,Italy,"This beautiful Riserva Barolo from the Josetta Saffirio winery opens with ripe aromas of blackberry and cassis syrup followed by nicely evolved tones of espresso, root beer, licorice and spice.

26625,France,"With its distinctive flower bottle, this is an immediately recognizable Champagne, both in its looks and its distinctive Perrier-Jouët elegance. Lively white fruits play with acidity and a tangy backbone of apple skins. Age this for 4–5 years and maybe more.",Fleur de Champagne Brut,93,139.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët
26627,US,"New oak stands out in toast and caramelized wood sweetness on this Cab, overshining to some degree the underlying blackberry, cherry and black currant fruit. It's quite a fashionable, delectable young wine, and will probably be consumed too early by many people who buy it, but it's really a cellar candidate. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it should develop for 12–15 years.",,93,145.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate
26628,France,"Pale pink in color, this is stylish rosé. It has the intense acidity of the 1996 vintage, meaning that it still tastes young, crisp, vibrant. The only suggestion that this is 14 years old is in the slight toastiness. But it should go on for many more years.",Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé,93,295.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Ruinart
26662,Germany,"Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable.",Trockenbeerenauslese,97,445.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
26663,US,"So delicious now, you can hardly keep your hands off it. Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth. Shows the class and potency this bottling has exhibited for many years, and believe it or not, the price is a relative bargain these days. Drink now–2020.",Special Selection,97,130.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
26664,Germany,"Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades.",Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese,97,612.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Robert Weil
26666,Germany,"A wonderfully drinkable beerenauslese, which makes it a serious accomplishment—sometimes these wines can just be too much. This one balances its intense dried apricot and golden raisin notes with tropical and citrus fruit and lively acidity.",Hochheimer Domdechaney Beerenauslese,96,271.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
26668,Germany,"Von Schubert bottled two eisweins from the Herrenberg in 2009. This one is pale in color, with intense pineapple and honey flavors. The wine is sweet, luscious and viscous yet never cloying, with a long finish that features unfolding layers of fruit flavor.",Herrenberg Eiswein,96,228.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
26675,Germany,"One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable.",Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Eiswein,95,448.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Schloss Saarstein
26676,Germany,"Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen. Dried apricots rule, but nuances of musky spice and candied pineapple play supporting roles. Unctuous enough to pair with dessert if need be, but better on its own, or perhaps with aged hard cheeses.",Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese,95,292.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Robert Weil
26677,Germany,"Terrific, from its nearly indefinable aromas akin to Cloud Ear fungus to its intensely sweet yet racy palate. Dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors give it substance without excessive weight, finishing long and intense. Drink now–2030.",Kiedrich Turmberg Auslese,95,142.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Robert Weil
26684,Germany,"So unctuous and decadently sweet that this is one of those TBAs that's best taken in very small sips. Dried apricot, candied pear and caramelized pineapple flavors are concentrated and intense, lingering sweetly on the long finish.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Vat 59 Trockenbeerenauslese,94,440.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,S.A. Prüm
26686,US,"Spicy, fruity and extremely youthful, this complex wine brings black cherry and cassis flavors with subtle notes of cola, licorice, allspice, sandalwood and pine needle. Still quite tight and primary, it has been beautifully sculpted into a focused wine with a long life ahead.",Arcus Estate,94,100.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Archery Summit
26688,US,"This is a frankly delicious young Cabernet, hailing from a small vineyard to showcase its qualities. It's deeply flavored in blackberries and currants, with the most delicious dark chocolate sweetness. Yet it also has the tannic backbone to last. It's one of those wines you can drink now, or age for at least six years to see what it can do.",Tomahawk,94,115.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
26691,Germany,"This historic estate certainly excelled with sweet wines in 2009. This auslese is lusciously sweet yet lithe, its ripe stone fruit—apricot and peach—balanced by citrusy notes. Finishes long and clean, not cloying. Delicious now, but should easily be capable of aging for 20–30 years.",Auslese,94,200.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
26694,Germany,"Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish.",Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein,94,376.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Robert Weil
26696,Germany,"Like all of the Schloss's noble sweet wines, this one isn't overblown, displaying ample sweetness but also zesty acidity. There's a slight greenish hint to the candied citrus and dried pineapple flavors, with a lemony streak on the finish that balances the sweetness impeccably. Should last for 40–50 years—possibly more—in a cool cellar.",Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Beerenauslese Goldkapsel,94,231.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Schloss Saarstein
26730,US,"A helluva Cabernet. Extraordinarily rich and opulent in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, with elaborate oak, yet completely dry, and given balance by firm, hard tannins and a fine cut of acidity. Really impressive now, after decanting, and should develop over the next six years, at the very least.",,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nice
26739,Germany,"The wine's floral aromas and somewhat restrained fruit on the nose strike a refined tone, while on the palate the wine is lush, round and sweet, buoyed by bright pineapple, peach and lime flavors. Finishes long and sleekly elegant.",Erdener Prälat Auslese Goldkapsel,93,114.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
26740,Germany,"This TBA features almost endless variations on the sugary theme: caramelized sugar, demarara syrup and honey all swirl together, wrapped around a bit of citrusy acidity. A distinctly musky spice note adds interest. Drink now–2040.",Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Trockenbeerenauslese - 375 ml,93,250.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
26741,France,"Intense wood-aged wine. The wood is still apparent in this intense, youthful wine, although the richly concentrated mint and black fruit flavors are sure to come through in a year or two. This is certainly ageworthy, a wine that packs all the right structure and dark fruit character.",GC,93,139.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
26746,Germany,"Lush and decadent, with intensely sweet notes of demarara syrup, peach and citrus, yet there's enough acidity to bring you back for another sip, and another. The sugar clings to the palate for a long time on the finish. Drink now–2030.",Graacher Himmelreich Vat 69 Eiswein,93,175.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,S.A. Prüm
26748,US,"A textbook illustration of Stags Leap Cabernet. The “velvet glove” is the elaborately ripe, sweet blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit. The “iron fist” is the tannin structure, so finely woven you hardly notice it, but there it is, offering a coat of astringency and protecting the wine over the next decade.",Ganymede,93,105.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
26775,Chile,"Chile's most expensive wine is excellent, and with only 50 cases being imported it's definitely a collector's edition. The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas. The palate is racy and tannic, and the flavors of plum, cassis, blackberry, chocolate, prune and fig are elevated. A tough and ribald wine that will be at its best from 2012–2015.",Viñedo Chadwick,92,260.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
26776,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.",,92,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
26798,Germany,"Dark, almost russet in color, this is an eiswein that's definitely out of the ordinary, with notes of fusty library, walnut, dried apricots and figs that come across as a bit syrupy in texture. It seems a bit advanced compared to other eisweins, but it will likely remain at this plateau for decades.",Herrenberg Eiswein 82,93,316.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
26826,France,"All raspberries and red currants, this is a delicious, instantly approachable wine. It also has a more complex side, intense acidity, a tight texture followed by a juicy fruit character. It is a wine for celebration as well as more serious appreciation.",Fleur de Champagne Rosé Brut,92,349.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët
26828,US,"This is a very nice Cabernet that feels rich in the mouth, a wine that will have everybody remarking on its smooth, velvety texture. Taste-wise, it shows an olive tinge to the red and black cherry fruit, with a beautiful overlay of smoky oak. You can drink it now, with a good decant, and it should develop in the bottle over the next 6–9 years, if not longer.",,92,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
26832,Italy,"Here's a Barolo that lives up to its “riserva” status thanks to aged aromas of old spice, leather, black mineral, root beer, tar and menthol-like intensity. There are some earthy, dusty tones on the finish and the wine imparts firm, ripe tannins in the mouth. Riservas are usually aged one more year than base Barolos.",Preve Riserva,92,125.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Gagliardo
26880,Austria,"Very smooth, concentrated blend of Merlot and Blaufränkisch. There are considerable smoky wood flavors along with ripe berry fruit notes and a dark, firm edge that will soften as the wine ages. It has power, density and finishes dry. Age for 5–6 years.",Tesoro,92,115.0,Burgenland,,,Austrian Red Blend,Esterházy
26897,Argentina,"Without doubt the most full and complete Chardonnay from Argentina that this critic has tried. It smells lush and toasty, with elegant apple and pear aromas. The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.",White Stones Adrianna Vineyard,92,115.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
26909,Germany,"A big, sturdy auslese, nearly dry in style yet showing some botrytis and plenty of concentration. Hints of dried apricots and mushrooms lead the way, and there is some citrusy character, but this brooding wine is best served with cheeses or savory dishes.",Erbacher Steinmorgen Auslese,91,107.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Baron Knyphausen
26955,Italy,"The celebrated Cerequio cru is known for its elegant and refined wines. However, in this hot vintage, you can taste the maturity of the fruit thanks to the wine's aromas of plum, prune and spice cake. Clay soils help shape the wine's natural density and structure.",Cerequio,91,120.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Contratto
26965,France,"This is 100% Pinot Noir, which gives richness to the wine. It is generous, with red apple and pear flavors, still very fresh. An attractive final bite says that it will age.",Cuvée Garance Blanc de Rouges,91,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Thiénot
26985,Italy,"From southern, coastal Tuscany comes this opulent, richly textured Chardonnay that competes with the best of France and California.

33342,US,"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.",Harmonie,94,120.0,California,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Capture
33355,US,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",Révélation,94,140.0,California,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Capture
33645,US,"This is a very expensive Cabernet, but it also tastes dramatic and powerful. The chocolate, blackberry, currant and oak flavors are massive, while the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. Feels as lush as California Cab gets, but never loses integrity or balance.

33656,US,"At nearly seven years in age, this 100% Cabernet is still offering ripe, fresh blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors. It feels young, with firm, hard tannins, but very fine and complex. Just at the beginning of its journey, it will easily reward further cellaring.

34203,France,"While this is the top wine of a major Cahors estate, it is impressive how restrained it is. Sure, the wood and dense brooding black fruits are there, but they have been subtly controlled by the freshness of the wine and its great balance.

43084,US,"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood.

47440,France,"Very mineral in character, this young wine is all green fruit. The citrus and grapefruit are intense, and full of ripe acidity.

47442,US,"Even though 2008 was not the greatest Cabernet vintage, Rubicon has produced one of the most delicious bottlings of the year. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with a little Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot for complexity, it's so delicious now, you might want to finish off the bottle. Soft and velvety, it appeals with blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, and the oak appliqué is perfect. Combines the ripeness of this central Napa Valley vineyard with impeccable winemaker taste, resulting in a gorgeous wine. Will develop through this decade.",,95,175.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate

47447,US,"Loads of sweet, pure, ripe and refined blackberry fruit in this dry, young Cabernet. It's very tannic, with a lockdown astringency, but the fruit is so strong, it punches right through. The idea here clearly is the cellar. Eight years seems like no problem. Twenty years may not even be pushing things.",Estate Grown Celebrating 150 Years,94,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
47448,US,"Here's one for the cellar. It's an intense, massively concentrated wine, packed with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and crême de cassis flavors. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the tannins are as fine and complicated as Napa gets. So tasty now, you can drink it with a great steak, and should easily develop bottle complexity over the next 8–10 years, perhaps much longer.",Reserve,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,ZD
47458,France,"Solid and firm, this is a wine with a considerable future. The plum and ripe berries are changing into a more mature, smoky, undergrowth character.

47490,US,"The Merlot that dominates this wine shows in the wealth of red and black cherries, but one-third Cabernet Sauvignon contributes its telltale signature of blackberries and black currants. New oak, however, dominates in the wine's youth, giving caramel and roasted marshmallow flavors. Very fine, very concentrated and intense, and in need of cellaring.

47518,France,"Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight.

47572,US,"Lush, soft and delicious, this has flavors of chocolate, ripe crushed summer blackberries and a hint of dried currants. This richness is augmented by lots of smoky, sweet oak.

47645,Spain,"Earthy, dark and meaty wine, with rubber, deep black fruit, bacon and leather on the nose.

47693,France,"This is already delicious, a wine that opens with the juiciest fruit, great wafts of perfumed raspberry juice followed by vivid acidity.

47700,US,"The 2008 vintage wasn't the greatest ever in Napa, and this isn't the greatest ever Staglin Cabernet. But it is one of the successes of the vintage, showing how a great winery rises over vintage limitations. Feels lush and dramatic in the mouth, with lush, smooth tannins housing classic Cabernet flavors of black currants, plums, green olives and dark chocolate, accented with spicy, smoky oak. Should develop in the bottle over at least six years, and could be one of those sleepers that surprises in 20.",,94,185.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin
47702,France,"While the aroma has pronounced new wood characters, the palate is more subtle, emphasizing the powerful dark fruits, coffee note and sweet fruit tannins as much as wood.

47706,US,"A big wine, saturated in color and tremendously extracted in fruity richness. Explodes in blackberries, cassis and sweet new oak, and the tannins are strong and refined. Not particularly drinkable now, because the parts are only clumsily melded, but seems like a serious cellar candidate. Should begin to blossom in 6–8 years and, given this wine's history, will be rocking by 2020.",Backus Vineyard,93,250.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
47709,US,"This has been pretty much Martini's best Cabernet Sauvignon over the last few years, and with this '08, the winery commits itself to playing in the major leagues.

47723,France,"A gorgeously ripe wine, its rounded yellow fruits tempered by wood aging. There is a mineral core, with a steely character to go with the pure pleasures of the rich fruit.

47941,US,"A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now.

48261,Australia,"There's a lifted quality to the bouquet of this wine that's slightly distracting, but also plenty of cherry fruit. In fact, it's the somewhat monolithic nature of the fruit that's most disappointing; for a wine of this lauded reputation there needs to be more evidence of complexity.

48289,Spain,"Rich, earthy and structured, with graphite, bacon and dense black fruit aromas that promise the wine will pack punch. With big, biting tannins, it does that.

48471,US,"A terrific Pinot, and one of the few that absolutely demands cellaring. The tannic structure is enormous, providing a sandpapery dryness to the palate. Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced.

It is tight, solid and certainly for aging.",Vintage,96,100.0,Port,,,Port,Niepoort
48479,Portugal,"From a parcel of old vines around the quinta chapel, this is a stunning wine. It has all the opulence we expect from Vesuvio, along with a density that is rare in this vintage.

48534,Argentina,"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents. It's solid and textured in the mouth, with creamy oak flavors alongside sawdust, milk chocolate and sweet berry notes.

48540,France,"Smoky, new-wood aromas and flavors cloak the black berry fruit in this wine. It has a hard edge at the moment, like concentrated wood juice.

48794,Argentina,"A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet.

48798,France,"With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine.

The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine.",Les Cailles Premier Cru,91,115.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
48805,US,"An interesting new wine that aims for balance and elegance rather than powerful fruit extraction. Shows an acid-inspired crispness that brightens wild berry, currant, cola and peppery spice flavors. Despite the silky mouthfeel, it feels undeveloped.

48845,France,"Now at its best, this is a wine showing tannins, dry raisins as well as tense acidity. It is mature, ripe, definitely ready for drinking.

49149,US,"This is a thoroughly modern Cabernet. It could come from the Napa Valley floor, and is not particularly representative of Knights Valley.

49315,Spain,"Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum.

49419,Spain,"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors.

49467,US,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend based on the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc. It's made in the modern style, soft, ripe and oaky.

49508,US,"Very rich, if a bit of a letdown after the '07.

49820,US,"A very hard, tannic wine. Assaults the palate like barbarian invaders, pillaging with astringency. Yet buried deep down is a luscious core of black currants and minerals.

The fruit shows cherry and cassis, and the alcohol (listed at 14.9%) is mostly contained. But it's a hard wine, and does not seem to have the complex aromatics that promise more detail with age.

50361,Argentina,"By Nicasia's high previous standards, this wine from a substandard vintage is lacking. After an opening of sweet berry aromas, cured meat and spice, it's very sweet and candied tasting, with milk chocolate and carob flavors along with unabsorbed oak.

51040,US,"A really rich Cabernet, jam-packed with blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors that are slightly sweet, with a brown sugar taste. The sweetness comes from the caramelized oak, not residual sugar, but the wine does have a candied quality. A bit rustic now. Give it 5–6 years and try again.",Rennie Reserve,89,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
51050,Australia,"In 5–10 years, this rating may look conservative, but right now, this wine's tannins are just too rustic and tough to be certain of its future evolution. It's a massive wine overall, with brambly, briary fruit, tinged with clove, cedar and chocolate, and those drying, astringent tannins on the finish.",Emily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc,89,125.0,Victoria,Heathcote,,Red Blend,Jasper Hill
51141,US,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal. Blackberries, blueberries, cherries and exotic spices characterize the flavors of this tremendous wine, one of the best of the vintage out of the Anderson Valley. Only 222 cases were produced.",Ten Degrees,98,100.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
51142,Germany,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.",Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen Trockenbeerenauslese - 375 ml,97,245.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan
51143,US,"So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot. Superbly enjoyable, but as a brand new wine, its future is only a guess. Drink now–2014?",,97,250.0,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Au Sommet
51145,US,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",Obsidian,97,120.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Arkenstone
51147,Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Leiwener Laurentiuslay Beerenauslese,96,175.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
51148,France,"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish.",Legend Vintage,96,380.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Maury,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
51149,US,"This dramatic, compulsively good Cabernet is the first Howell Mountain Cab ever from the winery. It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control. Really defines an important new step for this veteran winery. Drink now–2020.",Limited Release,96,120.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
51420,US,"So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor. The blackberry and cassis flavors have an edge of chocolate, and the deliciousness is compounded by superbly ripe, sculpted tannins and a long but thoroughly dryfinish. Dazzlingly good, and could develop bottle complexity over the years.",Obsidian,95,120.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Arkenstone
51421,France,"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced.",Legend Vintage,95,350.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rivesaltes,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
51425,US,"One sip is all it takes to understand that this is a vital, impressive and possibly profound wine. A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it. Exceptionally flavorful in blackberries and cherries, it has tantalizing hints of herbs, olive tapenade and, of course, intensely fine oak. Drink now–2016.",,95,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Amuse Bouche
51427,Germany,"Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking. Honeyed citrus aromas are buoyed by hints of perfume and spice, with dried apricot flavors accented by spiced honey. Mouthcoating, rich and impossibly long, this wine should easily age for 40 or more years.",Forster Kirchenstück Beerenauslese 375 ml,95,239.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan
51432,US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
51435,US,"The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it. But as it warms and airs, the fascinating palate begins to unfold. Will age effortless for many years. Drink now–2020.",Volcanic Hill,94,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
51437,Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.",Nicolas Catena Zapata,94,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Bodega Catena Zapata
51442,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
51456,Spain,"Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out. Flavors of loud oak, black fruits, hard spices, toast and licorice finish peppery, tough and with some heat. Best from 2015–2023.",Alabaster,95,220.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
51457,US,"Made from various St. Helena vineyards, with some additions from eastern Oakville, it expresses all the beauty of Napa Valley Cab. The flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky cedar are absolutely delicious. Yet the wine possesses structure, not the easiest thing to achieve with a 100% Cabernet this rich. The wine should age well through 2020, but there's no reason not to drink it now.",Generations,95,130.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
51459,US,"Grown in one of the valley's best vineyards, it's eminently ageable. The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2024, and it could be awesome in 2030.",M5 Stagecoach Vineyard,95,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krupp Brothers
51462,US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows hard tannins and dryness despite the intensely ripe blackberries and cherries at its core. Two-thirds new French oak is not too much, adding balancing toast and wood tannins. This gorgeous wine will begin to come into its own by 2018, and should evolve for many more years.",Core Stone,95,125.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Oakville East
51465,US,"There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",Private Reserve,95,126.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coomber Family Ranch
51720,US,"This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice. Winemaker Luisa Ponzi does her usual excellent job of putting the polish on outstanding fruit. Give it another decade and it will show its best.",Abetina Vineyard,93,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi
51739,France,"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout. Full and rich but lively, with medium acidity and a zippiness to the finish. Enjoyable now, but this will benefit from another 5–10 years in the cellar.",Legend Vintage,93,300.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Banyuls,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
51744,US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
51774,US,"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this reserve is aromatically distinctive.

51886,France,"A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard.

51888,France,"A glorious Champagne, now at the peak of its powers and maturity.

51889,France,"Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more.",RD Brut Champagne,97,260.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
51890,France,"Exceptionally rich and dense, an exceptional wine that reveals itself in layers, from the first fruit attack to the mineral texture and the way it gradually fills the mouth.

51893,France,"With all the extreme intensity of this vintage, this wine brings even more.

It is still young, just keep aging.",Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut,97,185.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Henriot
51894,Italy,"Bravo! The Brunate cru has awarded Vietti with a stellar product: a wine that is unusually dark and plush with impressive intensity and crafted aromas of black fruit, spice, earth, licorice, balsam and gianduia chocolate-hazelnut spread.

51898,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

52059,US,"The name is silly, but the wine is serious. The winemaker wisely blended in some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot to add structure to Cab Franc's seductive fruit.

52170,France,"Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex.

Given the fresh, intense fruit, this will certainly age for many years.",Brut,96,350.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
52171,Italy,"It's hard to beat the quality achieved by this spectacular wine. Luciano Sandrone's Barolo from the Cannubi Boschis cru is creamy, rich, opulent and sophisticated. It oozes flavors of espresso, ripe cherry, cassis, cola and licorice. In the mouth, it is extraordinarily bright and generous and the seamless finish can be counted in long minutes.

52175,France,"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast.

52177,France,"As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity.

52188,Italy,"Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more.",Rocche,95,130.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
52191,France,"A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity.

52261,US,"Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years.",Backus,97,225.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
52262,France,"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly.

An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity.

52278,US,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time.

Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",Insignia,95,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
52279,US,"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power.

It has already been aged an extra year, but would benefit from cellaring even longer, so wait until 2015.",Garrus,92,100.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château d'Esclans
52503,France,"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",Brut Rosé,94,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
52504,France,"With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity. With its complex poise between lightness and richness, this remains an intensely impressive wine.",Grande Cuvée Brut,94,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
52512,US,"Such are the tannins in this 100% Cab that it demands cellar time. It's really shut down and astringent in youth, which emphasizes the dryness. But it's very fine, with a solid core of ripe black cherry fruit that will express its sweetness when the tannins melt away. Winemaker Amy Aiken is really showing her stuff with this polished ager. Best 2013–2019.",Morisoli Vineyard,94,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meander
52516,Italy,"Nei Cannubi from Poderi Einaudi is textbook Barolo; the kind of wine you can bank on for an elegant and enlightening drinking experience. You see that, here, all the elements are perfectly in place and stacked for maximum pleasure. Aromas of blue flower, berry and shaved mineral build in intensity and the wine is determined and persistent on the palate.",Nei Cannubi,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
52527,Italy,"Barolo La Serra from Gianni Voerzio would make a perfect companion to pulled pork smoked over hardwood charcoal. There's a sassy spice element here backed by plush layers of blueberry, blackberry and plum. The tannins are still on the young, astringent side; give this wine some time to unwind in the cellar.",La Serra,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Voerzio
52528,Italy,"Barolo Ornato is a beautiful wine: rich in flavor, intensity and personality. You can taste the quality of the fruit here thanks to the pristine notes of cherry, wild berry, spice and ginger that emerge from the nose. Oak notes of vanilla and cinnamon are nicely integrated and folded within the wine's dense, supple texture.",Ornato,94,109.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare
52564,US,"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lookout Ridge
52568,France,"The high toast aromas, typical of Chanson wines, can be off-putting. But get beyond the wood, which needs a couple more years to integrate, and the ripe fruit of 2005 gives this wine density and character. The yellow fruits, ripe cantaloupe melon flavor and sweet acidity will more than hold their own against the wood.",,94,235.0,Burgundy,Corton Vergennes,,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils
52570,France,"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",Les Pucelles Premier Cru,94,273.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
52571,US,"Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy. Hard now, a bit austere, but beautifully structured, with a thick, currant-infused taste. Needs time.",St. Eden,94,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
52576,France,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",,94,150.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Olivier Leflaive
52578,France,"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich.

52579,France,"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.",Réserve de l'Obédience Les Blanchots Grand Cru,93,145.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Laroche
52582,France,"Showing the typical power of Corton-Charlemagne, this is a classic wine that offers full-on fruit allied to a strong wood element. It is rich and bold, flavored with white fruits, apricots, almonds and spice. While it is drinkable now, it would certainly repay cellaring for 3–4 years.",,93,130.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Maison Champy
52589,US,"Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors.

52643,Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas. Next in line is a chewy, dark palate of wild berry and earthy fruit flavors. Clean on the finish with a bit less acidity than its brothers, Altamira and Mirador. Drink now through 2015.",Finca Bella Vista,91,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer
52801,US,"A beautiful, rich, elegant, fancy sparkling wine. Feels so fine in the mouth, all silk and satin, with deep, dry raspberry, strawberry, vanilla, toast, yeasty lees, brioche and honey flavors. Superb, but young. Needs time. Give it until 2011, if you can keep your hands off, and should develop until 2015, if not longer.",J. Schram,94,100.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
52808,US,"Erupts out from the glass with beautiful Cabernet perfume, suggesting cherry pie from the oven, licorice, sandalwood and dusty dried herbs, like sage and thyme. Very dry, with a long spicy finish, but also quite tannic, although lots of the tannins come from new oak. Best to age this polished 100% Cab for at least six years.",Reserve,94,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
52818,US,"This is a very rich wine. Complex, too. With every sip, it seems to offer a little more of itself. On the surface, it's dry, tannic and fruity, with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. But it has mineral and herb nuances that seem to spring from the soil, and the depth and finish are impressive. Drinkable now for sheer luxury, and should continue to develop over the next decade.",Dancing Bear Ranch,94,105.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cakebread
52821,Italy,"A Barolo superstar on the rise—keep a close watch on the wines of Gianni Gagliardo and family. This expression from the prized Cannubi cru offers impressive intensity and personality with enticing aromas of black fruit, cola, root beer, cured beef, cedar and white truffle.

52827,France,"This famed single vineyard on its steep slope above Mareuil-sur-Aÿ produces a warm, always elegant wine.

Drink now, or age another few years.",Clos des Goisses Brut,94,200.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
52864,Argentina,"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",No. 55,93,100.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra

52875,US,"Famed winemaker Cathy Corison brings her restrained touch to this Cabernet for Lookout Ridge's guest winemaker series, which benefits charity. It's a dry, tannic wine that's a little too young to drink now. But it's classically proportioned, with lush currant and cedar flavors. Made from Corison's Kronos Vineyard, it will be best after 2011.",Cathy Corison,93,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lookout Ridge
52877,France,"Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.",,93,189.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Bertrand Ambroise
52883,US,"This is a New World, cult-style Cab whose high alcohol creates an impression of sweetness, but not of heat.

52907,US,"Awfully good, a wine that strikes you right off the bat as important and complex. It's dry and densely packed in blackberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Very good and rich, with complicated tannins, and soft enough to drink now, although it should age well.",Red Rock Terrace,91,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
53100,Italy,"From the celebrated Bricco Asili cru, this Barbaresco is a beautiful embodiment of elegance, grace, harmony and complexity.

53114,Italy,"Barolo Colonnello is a determined, confident wine with a rich, succulent style and ripe aromas of blackberry, spice, sweet vanilla and polished black stone.

53127,US,"Dark, bold, potent and young are just a few words to describe this Cabernet, which contains a splash of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant and violet flavors that turn sweet and chocolaty on the finish, although the wine itself is perfectly dry. Quite tannic, which suggests ageability, although high alcohol of 15.5% will be controversial in some circles.

53168,US,"Erickson is the winemaker at Screaming Eagle, and he participated in this charitable project for Lookout Ridge. A blend of the two Cabernets, it's soft, unctuous and decadent, in the modern cult Napa style. Floods the mouth with pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, currants, cassis, chocolate and bacon.

53182,New Zealand,"This is among the most expensive wines from New Zealand, but it is also among the best. Ripe blueberry and blackberry flavors are rich on the palate and thickly textured, but accented by hints of smoked meat and framed by soft tannins. The oak, notable for its cedary, toasty aromas, virtually disappears on the palate.",Homage,92,125.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Trinity Hill
53201,US,"This Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is the most inaccessible of Merryvale's '07 portfolio, and it consequently offers the least pleasure now. It's quite rich in blackberries and currants but the tannins are considerable, and 90% new oak buries the fruit under a cloak of char and wood tannins. Feels rustic, but obviously pedigreed and extremely ageable. The score could soar over the next 6–9 years as the wine develops in the bottle.",Profile,91,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale

53410,Italy,"This edition of the prized Cerequio Barolo by Michele Chiarlo flaunts its own unique personality with immediate aromas of white cherry, red apple, tar, licorice powder and root beer.

Overall, this Barolo is beautiful and special.",Le Vigne,93,155.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
53472,Spain,"Hailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum.

Drink through 2020.",Unico,91,450.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Vega Sicilia
53479,Spain,"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness.

53505,US,"Impresses for its depth, power and balance, a wine whose classic acid-tannin structure could only have come from a pedigreed terroir.

Best 2011 and beyond.",Limited,92,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silverado
53512,France,"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood.

53700,France,"A gloriously rich rosé that is full of ripe raspberries that burst in the mouth. It has a tight texture, balanced by a rounded feel.

53704,Italy,"This beautiful Riserva Barolo from the Josetta Saffirio winery opens with ripe aromas of blackberry and cassis syrup followed by nicely evolved tones of espresso, root beer, licorice and spice.

53715,France,"With its distinctive flower bottle, this is an immediately recognizable Champagne, both in its looks and its distinctive Perrier-Jouët elegance.

53717,US,"New oak stands out in toast and caramelized wood sweetness on this Cab, overshining to some degree the underlying blackberry, cherry and black currant fruit. It's quite a fashionable, delectable young wine, and will probably be consumed too early by many people who buy it, but it's really a cellar candidate. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it should develop for 12–15 years.",,93,145.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate
53718,France,"Pale pink in color, this is stylish rosé. It has the intense acidity of the 1996 vintage, meaning that it still tastes young, crisp, vibrant.

53773,Italy,"From the Orcia area of Tuscany, here's a blockbuster 70-30 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot with deep concentration and thick density. Evident woodshop or carpentry tones come into play, leaving long-lasting flavaors of vanilla bean, chocolate and coffee. The wine has tart, plump tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging before they settle into place. Drink after 2015.",Guardiavigna,91,135.0,Tuscany,Orcia,,Red Blend,Podere Forte
53908,US,"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",Padrone Proprietary Red Wine,97,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Signorello
54132,US,"This limited-production offering pays tribute to Bill Fuller, founder of Tualatin Vineyards and one of the pioneers of Oregon's modern era wine industry.

54184,US,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent.

54196,Spain,"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",Aurus,94,248.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende
54208,Portugal,"Dark raisin and dried apricot flavors manifest on this immensely dark, old goldhued wine.

54285,Chile,"Chile's most expensive wine is excellent, and with only 50 cases being imported it's definitely a collector's edition. The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas. The palate is racy and tannic, and the flavors of plum, cassis, blackberry, chocolate, prune and fig are elevated. A tough and ribald wine that will be at its best from 2012–2015.",Viñedo Chadwick,92,260.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
54286,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.",,92,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
54399,US,"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character.

54408,US,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla.

54608,US,"This is a very nice Cabernet that feels rich in the mouth, a wine that will have everybody remarking on its smooth, velvety texture.

54612,Italy,"Here's a Barolo that lives up to its “riserva” status thanks to aged aromas of old spice, leather, black mineral, root beer, tar and menthol-like intensity. There are some earthy, dusty tones on the finish and the wine imparts firm, ripe tannins in the mouth.

54793,US,"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins.

The layered mid-palate mixes grape, berry, cherry and plum, sweet and dense. The oak is applied moderately, not dominating as in past Leonetti reserves. It's a profound wine with a gorgeous, entrancing structure that is barely beginning its evolution. Flavors emerge in surprising succession, like spring wildflowers that pop up overnight.

It tips the scales at 16% alcohol, but wears it well, hiding it under hints of licorice and subtle wood spice and layers of blackberry and blueberry fruit.

57134,Australia,"The bulk of this year's Grange (77.5%) is from Barossa, with the remainder coming from McLaren Vale. It starts off with scents of maple syrup and lightly caramelized blackberries, plums and a hint of mocha, while on the palate it turns rich and creamy in texture with the bold fruit underscored by vanilla. There's plenty of power here, but it's restrained and tight.

57513,Italy,"Prunotto's Barolo from the Bussia cru delivers ripe and jammy tones of strawberry preserves and blackberry pie that sit heavy over Nebbiolo's characteristically ethereal aromas. This wine will appeal to those who enjoy a bigger, bolder style of Barolo that finishes with rich, succulent fruit.",Bussia,89,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Prunotto
57523,Italy,"This expression of Barolo from the Bussia cru opens with fleshy pulp, rich concentration and very intense aromas of cola, cherry, humus, licorice and grated ginger.

57562,US,"The alcohol is a shocking 16%, but the truth is this wine is deliciously drinkable, in a soft, velvety way.

Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors.

57598,Italy,"This excellent vineyard designate Brunello Riserva opens with a very elegant nose that includes elements of spice, toast, black fruit and dusty mineral.

57707,US,"The winery made its bones with its fabulous Sacrashe Cabernet from Rutherford. This is their first release from Diamond Mountain, and the result is quite interesting. In fact, it's very good, but disappointing, considering the price. The wine is firm and hard in tannins, with blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, yet it's a little lacking in depth.

57766,Australia,"In the cool 2004 vintage, the nearly 100-year-old vines of Henschke's Mount Edelstone Vineyard have yielded a tart, crisp wine of considerable cellaring potential. The scents of pepper, blackberries and potpourri and flavors of vanilla and raspberries are buoyed by velvety tannins and a creamy mouthfeel, tightening up on the long finish.

57773,Australia,"A single-vineyard wine that contains about 85% Shiraz, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache, this is an incredibly concentrated wine. Slightly lifted aromas keep it from seeming heavy, but the flavors are dense and fudge-like, chocolaty and superripe. Dusty tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through 2010, and it should age well through at least 2020.",Exile,92,160.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,The Colonial Estate
57775,Australia,"Even more spicy and meaty in nature than Gibson's Barossa bottling, this microcuvée—only 160 cases were bottled—highlights the savory side of Eden Valley Shiraz.

58009,US,"This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out.

58770,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer.

60908,US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together.

61553,France,"A Champagne that is very much wine.

The finish is very crisp and dry.",Cuvée Perle d'Ayala,93,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Ayala
61651,US,"A sturdy young Cabernet showing great harmony and class. It's fresh in ripe tannins, very poised and balanced, with a great depth of cedary blackberry fruit.

62035,US,"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.",Memento,92,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
62849,France,"Incredibly rich, velvety-textured and long, this is a great example of Hermitage from a superripe vintage.

Drink now–2025.",Les Bessards,95,146.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
63035,France,"At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?",Le Méal,94,134.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
63056,Italy,"Sumptuous and beautiful Barolo with subtle toasted notes, forest floor, cigar box and dried berries all vying for your attention.

63189,US,"Colgin's first Syrah, and the first from winemaker Mark Aubert, the wine is very dark and glyceriney, suggesting massive extract. Opens with an exciting blast of white pepper leading to baked cherry pie, leather, truffle and complex earthy scents. In the mouth, it's very fruity and chocolaty, with tons of toasty new oak. Yet there is something dramatic here. This is a Syrah to carefully watch in future vintages.",IX Estate,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Colgin
63202,Australia,"From the folks who bring you Two Hands comes this big Cab, which sticks to the glass and deals a chile-spiced nose right out of the gate.

63257,Hungary,"Meaning “honey pot,” Mézes Mály is an esteemed south-facing, first-growth vineyard. This wine has an oxidized character resulting in nutty aromas and cheese-rind flavors. Still, this wine also showed flavors of dried apricot and raisin, although none of the namesake honey. Finishes long, but the oxidative note was still a strike against this wine. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",Mézes Mály Aszú 6 Puttonyos,88,115.0,Tokaji,,,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji
63602,Italy,"This is not an in-your-face-wine.

The tannins are round and full, with a touch of perky spice.",Rocche,91,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
63761,US,"With this bottling Goldschmidt runs with the big Oakville dogs. Classic, a dry, tremendously concentrated and oaky Cab with massive flavors of blackberry tart, cassis, anise, cocoa and cedar.

63764,Argentina,"This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more.

Drink now through 2013.",Argentino,96,123.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
63766,Argentina,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches.

63771,Spain,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors.

63808,Australia,"Dark garnet-black in color, but as dark as it is, this is not one of those explosive, overextracted types of New World Pinot. This one serves up cherry flavors that are juicy but just shy of tart, and they're coated in a hefty helping of chalk or mineral. Narrow but very nice; finishes with an old-school iron-ore flavor.",Nantua Vineyard,90,100.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Pinot Noir,Giaconda
63938,Argentina,"Adrianna is a higher-elevation, higher-acid single-vineyard Malbec, and it's a component of the otherworldly Argentino blend. On its own, it's fresh, healthy and sturdy.

Drink now through 2012.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,123.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
63954,US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
64117,Argentina,"The nose is dusty and inviting, with notes of spiced berries, molasses, sandalwood and artisan soap.

64638,Germany,"A stunningly rich yet balanced dessert wine, this beauty starts with hints of paraffin and almonds, then unleashes waves of sweet dried-apricot and orange-marmalade flavors.

Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect. Terrific for contemplating on its own or with food. Versatility should be its middle name.",No. 55,94,100.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra

64776,US,"At nearly six years of age, this Cab tastes as fresh and tannic as a far younger wine. Those tannins remain firm and hard, and the blackberries and cherries still have a primary fruit taste. This likely will be one of those wines that takes a long time to show its stuff, but it's richly balanced and satisfying. Odds are this beautiful wine, from a veteran producer, will develop very well over the next ten years.",Dr. Crane Vineyard,93,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tom Eddy
64782,Argentina,"From vines planted in 1932, this Pinot Noir is simply beautiful. It's bigger and more dense than its younger brother, No. 55, but maybe a tad less elegant and a bit more cellar worthy. The aromas are a blend of fine French oak and natural Pinot aromas of tea, cherry and raspberry. Mineral and coffee appear late on the finish.

64785,US,"The difference from Luna's regular '04 Cab is in the increased alcohol, nearly 1% higher, and greater tannic structure.

65334,US,"This is an extraordinarily rich and rewarding Cabernet to drink now. Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight.

It's massive in fruit, exploding on the palate with in-your-face blackberries, black currants and cherries, not to mention caramelized oak. It's almost rude. Your only choice is to age it.

65771,France,"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.",Genevrières Premier Cru,93,110.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
65773,Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65776,France,"Always right at the top of Faiveley's wines, this is an impressive bottle for 2007. It has weight, a seamless texture that passes from firm tannins to sweet fruit. The acidity, which fits into the arc of the wine, and the tannins promise aging over many years.",,93,180.0,Burgundy,Corton,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Faiveley
65777,France,"Jayer-Gilles has vines on the lower slopes of the Echézeaux vineyard, hence the subtitle of the wine, “du Dessous.” The wine has finesse, but with structure, and is impressively powered with tannins (although with a nagging green bean character as it opens up), spice, a definite amount of toast as well as freshly acid red fruits.",Echézeaux du Dessous,93,259.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
65926,US,"Soft and lush and delicious, with deep, intriguing flavors of red and black berries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate and smoky cedar. A beautifully structured, classically layered wine, but also fairly tannic. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",Proprietary Red Wine,92,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Roy Estate

65932,France,"Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again.",Les Suchots Premier Cru,92,149.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
66012,France,"This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine.

66013,France,"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,96,360.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux
66014,France,"Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell.

66015,France,"Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant.

66016,France,"With its aromas of new wood, spice and black fruits, this promises from the start to be a powerful, polished wine. It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estèphe.

66019,France,"With its usual high proportion of Merlot, Palmer 2003 was always going to be a generous, very ripe wine. And so it is proving, but what is so satisfying about the wine at this stage is that the great sweet fruit, which comes right out of the glass. Underneath, of course, there are tannins, so this wine could be drunk soon, and then aged for another 15 years.

66020,France,"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity.

66027,France,"This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside.

66221,France,"Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity.

66235,France,"With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.",Charmes Premier Cru,91,145.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc
66360,France,"There is stunning perfume on this archetypal Pinot Noir. The tannins are soft for a Gevrey, but the red fruits are pure, giving a character that is both firm and sensuous.

66446,Italy,"This is beautiful but so atypical, it's difficult to place within the wider range of Amarone styles.

66624,New Zealand,"Much like the Bilancia La Collina, also crafted by winemaker Warren Gibson, there's a touch of stone-fruit character to this wine, along with plenty of black- and blueberry fruit.

66935,France,"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",Les Terres Blanches,89,105.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey

Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential.

68237,France,"Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040.",La Landonne,99,450.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,E. Guigal
68238,France,"This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt.

68241,France,"Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally.",De L'Orée,96,160.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
68242,France,"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020.",Le Méal,96,202.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
68245,France,"How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant?

68248,France,"From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.",Les Rocoules,95,140.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Marc Sorrel
68249,Spain,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish.

68372,France,"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.",L'Ermite,95,260.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
68374,Spain,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry.

68375,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers.

Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68377,France,"Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength. But this definitely has plenty of fruit for balance, mixing cassis with black olive, espresso, cinnamon and clove. Not quite as rich as the '03, but still a classic, with great persistence on the finish. Best after 2015.",Les Bessards,94,128.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
68378,France,"This was Chapoutier's initial microcuvée of Hermitage, bottled for the first time in 1989.

68380,France,"Intoxicatingly fruity and forward on the nose, this wine—a blend of Le Méal and Les Greffieux—follows up with rich layers of black fruit.

68382,Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

68387,Portugal,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style.

68393,France,"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality.

69139,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
69150,Italy,"Saturated and deep purple in color, this wine yields loads of toastiness, dry woodiness, soya and vanilla with a ripe undercurrent of blackberry and raspberry.

69165,Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.",Noemía,93,152.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
69166,France,"Full-bodied and deliciously supple, with layers of black cherries, plum, tea and exotic spices that gently caress the palate.

Imported by Vintus LLC.",Les Charmes Premier Cru,93,150.0,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,,Pinot Noir,Lucien Le Moine
69174,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",,93,150.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Lucien Le Moine
69222,US,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",Private Reserve,95,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
69302,France,"Complex from the first sniff, where it seems herbal, briary and even a bit peppery but simultaneously bacony, spicy and laced with red cherries. On the palate, it's mostly about sous-bois and spice, with just enough cherry fruit for balance. Briary and a bit drying on the finish, but the bet here is that this wine will age superbly. Try after 2010. Imported by Vintus LLC.",,92,130.0,Burgundy,Clos Saint-Denis,,Pinot Noir,Lucien Le Moine
69303,Australia,"There's just 350 cases produced of this terrific wine, which has light tobaccoey aromas layered over cherry pie.

69325,France,"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish.

69464,US,"Massive and tannic, and dry to the point of astringency, all this Cab needs is a decade or so to come around. The tannins are bigtime, locking the wine down, but there's a solid core of blackberry and cassis fruit. Once the wine has aged, the sweet fruit will emerge.

69562,US,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins.

69567,Austria,"One of Austria's great wines, this intense expression of an imposing vineyard explodes in the mouth. Its perfumed, floral character quickly gives way to a taut, tight mineral structure, a coiled spring with its white fruits, citrus and bright acidity all waiting to race out as the wine ages. Keep for at least five years.",Singerriedel Smaragd,95,126.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Franz Hirtzberger
69598,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
69601,Italy,"Inkjet black and super concentrated, the wine actually delivers fresh fruit and squeezed berry youthfulness.

69627,Spain,"Still young and jumpy, but the ripeness and pedigree of this Penedès bruiser is beyond reproach.

For fans of forward, beefy reds. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Grans Muralles,91,100.0,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,,Red Blend,Torres
69698,US,"This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to.

Better after 2010.",Reserve,94,125.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain

69710,Austria,"From Nikolaihof's reserve library collection, this is living, vivid proof of the aging ability of Grüner Veltliner.

This is a wine to savor, to sip and relish.",Vinothek,94,208.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Nikolaihof
69725,France,"Made from 70–80-year-old estate-grown vines, this boasts a tremendously complex and seductive bouquet of smoke, violets, raspberries and blackberries. In the mouth, it's a bit less exciting although still very good; it's juicy and fresh, with some firm tannins that are accentuated by crisp acidity.

70237,US,"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute.

70241,US,"An amazingly rich, complex and ageworthy wine. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar.

70244,US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity.

70246,US,"This is a very high-class Cabernet. You can tell from the sumptuous tannins and the overall balance and elegance.

70255,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors.

It's really not drinkable now, despite very complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, tobacco and plums, along with plenty of smoky new oak. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while.

70326,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive.

70726,US,"A challenging wine, one whose future is hard to predict. The immediate impact is very rich and ripe, with flavors of milk chocolate, blackberry jam and caramelized oak.

71056,US,"Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years.",Special Selection,97,136.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
71064,US,"This is what people who pay a hundred bucks for a Napa Cab expect. Soft, ripe and enormously attractive, it seduces the palate with gooey red and black currant, cherry, blueberry, melted Swiss chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that just pile up and up and go on and on. The tannins, needless to say, are the finest money can buy. It's impossible not to be impressed by a wine of this pedigree and accomplishment.

71145,US,"The 2006 vintage was not kind to Beringer's Cabernets, and this esteemed bottling is no exception. It's tough and gritty, the kind of wine that may have a future but whose present is not particularly acceptable at this price. Extreme tannins lock it down. Tastes almost old-fashioned. But it does have a rich vein of blackberries and black currants, and who knows? It could come around after many years.",Private Reserve,88,115.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
71224,US,"Tannins and acids currently dominate, giving this dry, young wine a bit of a lockdown quality. The winemaker, Michael Trujillo, aims at a more structured style, and he has achieved it here.

72010,US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend will make you take a second look at Paso Robles.

72013,Spain,"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents.

72080,US,"This is one of those wines that grows more attractive the more it airs in the glass. At first, it just impresses with ripe blackberry and cassis fruit and lots of oak. As it breathes, subtler notes emerge, lending it charm and complexity. Still, it remains quite tannic. High alcohol may limit ageability, so drink it over the next few years.",,92,115.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pont de Chevalier

72230,US,"Atypical of a Rutherford Cabernet, this is in fact unlike most of today's expensive Cabernets from anywhere in Napa Valley. It's aggressively tannic and dry, and it seems emulate an older style, though the alcohol is considerably higher than anything from the old days.

72347,Germany,"Richly textured and unabashedly full in body, this dry Riesling is intensely ripe. Pineapple and peach flavor is accented by zesty lime peel and earthy tones of wet stone and lanolin. The midpalate is lifted by a whiff of violet perfume and bold, lemon-lime acidity envigorates the finish.",Westhofen Morstein GG Trocken,92,115.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Wittmann
72348,US,"After a period of volatility, Hommage, which is the winery's highest expression of Cabernet, returns to form. At the age of six years, it's soft and mellow, although still rich in tannins, with blackberry, chocolate, plum and cassis liqueur flavors that are deep and long in the finish. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's stylishly delicious now, and should develop for 6–8 years, although the softness mitigates against longterm aging.",Hommage Tenma Vineyard,92,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos Pegase
72352,France,"From the legendary 1996 vintage, this is a bottling that only received its dosage in 2012. It is very dry, intensely crisp and packed with acidity and minerality.

72356,US,"Richness is the operative word with this 100% Cabernet. That's due to the exceptional ripeness, reflected in opulent blackberry, cherry and milk chocolate flavors, as well as in the high alcohol, which gives it a heady, porty heat. Not an ager, but an opulent Napa Cab to drink now.",Blueline Vineyard,91,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hourglass
72699,US,"Give this deliciously polished 100% Cab a year or two in the bottle to let all the parts come together. It's rich and forward in black and red cherries, red currants and licorice, with a generous overlay of sweet, toasty oak.",,91,110.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
72937,US,"Rich, ripe blackberry, cherry, mocha, anise and cedar flavors mark this 100% Cabernet. The tannins are evident in a puckery astringency, but it's not too hard to drink it now with tannin-busting foods, like steak. Shows a classy, Napa-esque flashiness, although it doesn't seem to be an ager.",,91,110.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude

73303,US,"Full-throttle Burgundian technique marks this Chardonnay. It's explosive with buttered toast and popcorn and apricot and orange jam flavors. There's a fine streak of lime acidity. It's an exciting wine, as opulent as California Chard gets, if a little over-the-top, venturing beyond balance into opulence for its own sake.",Finch Hollow Estate Grown Cave Fermented,91,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Jarvis
73305,US,"High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.",,91,155.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hourglass
73318,France,"This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity.

73841,Italy,"Emidio Pepe shows excellent results with the 2001 vintage of his landmark Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.

73848,US,"Blended mainly from Grenache, with 20% Syrah, this is one of the biggest, most extracted red wines ever to come out of Paso Robles. The alcohol is a ridiculously high 16.2% by volume, but it's balanced the same way that high alcohol in Port is balanced. The flavors are enormously rich with raspberry and cherry jam, white chocolate and buttered toast.

74057,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",Family Reserve,97,625.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming
74060,US,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.",Family Reserve,96,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Venge

74067,US,"A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.",,95,170.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming
74075,Australia,"This is a potent, rich Shiraz. It's full bodied and thickly textured, with aromas and flavors of mocha, asphalt and plum.

74206,US,"This is a big, strong Cabernet, flooding the mouth with intensely ripe blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and white pepper flavors. It's tannic and acidic, and the oak hasn't been integrated at all with the fruit. Everything should begin to come together by 2017.",,90,115.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Knights Bridge
74210,US,"It's easy to use the word “huge” to describe this Cabernet, which contains smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It immediately takes over the palate with ripe, opulent cherry pie, blackberry tart, cassis liqueur, green olive and oak flavors. The tannins are very strong, the most powerful of Mondavi Cabernets in years. Which leads to the question of ageability. Where's this wine going? On the negative side is high alcohol, which gives it a burn. So drink it over the next 5–6 years.",Reserve,90,135.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
74212,France,An elegant wine that is given weight by its rich black fruits and style by the balance between tannins and acidity.

74404,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Memento,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
74405,US,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure.

74414,US,"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine.

74977,US,"Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew.

74992,US,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager.

Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish.

It's very rich and ripe, a wine that will appeal to fans of the modern California style for its voluptuous berry, cherry, cassis, spice and cedar flavors. The tannins are soft and gentle. Delicious and complex, if not quite up to the 2007. Give it a good, long decant.",,91,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Continuum
82176,Argentina,"A black-fruit aroma comes with accents of tobacco and prune but also a strong, almost vegetal green angle. It feels nice and full, with green-leaning flavors of spiced berry and juniper. Tobacco, bitter lettuce and green bean notes all make appearances on the finish. This is a blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",,88,100.0,Other,Salta,,Red Blend,Bodega Tacuil
82260,France,"At the pinnacle of Gevrey-Chambertin, Chambertin Grand Cru produces immensely powerful wines. This Jessiaume fits the profile well, while also having delicious juiciness to go with the dark tannins and acidity. The result is stylish as well as concentrated. Age for 10 years at least.",,94,115.0,Burgundy,Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Maison Jessiaume
82261,US,"A beautiful wine, supple and delicious. Classically dry and tannic, it shows fascinating, elusive blackberry, blueberry, currant and herb flavors, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. Lots going on here, and it should develop nicely in the bottle over the next decade.",Stature,94,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson
82267,US,"Shows the dryness, acidity and tightly wound minerality of all Hanzell's young Chardonnays, but with a depth of citrus and apricot fruit that marks it as a reserve. It really warrants time in the cellar. Best after 2013, and should develop for several more years.",Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard,94,130.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
82275,US,"Lots going on in this mountain-grown wine. It's perfectly dry and strong in tannins, with an elusive quality of excellence that testifies to the best terroir. Showing blackberry, black cherry, mineral and oak flavors, it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next decade.",La Muse,94,260.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité
82277,Argentina,"Among Catena's high-end wines from 2007, Nicasia is the top performer. It shows alluring aromas of smoky oak, wild flowers and pure berry fruits. The palate is a blend of smoothness, grainy tannins and fine acidity, while the flavors of berries, chocolate and cola are layered just right. Still the pacesetter for high-end Argentine Malbec; drink now through 2015.",Nicasia Vineyard,94,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
82285,Argentina,"Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
82329,Portugal,"An impressively structured wine, the dense and dusty tannins in fine balance with the big berry fruits.

82561,US,"A wonderful, rewarding blend that has enough blackberry, cassis and smoky oak flavors to satisfy hedonists, yet also shows the acid-tannic structure to develop bottle complexity over the years. Drink this flashy wine now and through 2018.",Journey,93,135.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Matanzas Creek
82566,France,"Mineral textured, this wine pushes the power of wines in Gevrey-Chambertin. It is all tannins, dark structure, powerful acidity, very concentrated. It needs many years—10 or more.",,93,110.0,Burgundy,Mazis-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Maison Jessiaume
82585,US,"A darkly colored, tannic Cabernet whose dry astringency keeps it from being thoroughly enjoyable now.

Elegant and classy, it should age well throughout the decade.",,93,300.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cardinale

82814,France,"A single-vineyard wine, this is firmly structured and full of perfumed fruit. New wood aging gives the red berry fruit a smoky, toasty character.

82867,France,"Rich, packed with  juicy fruit. The wine has weight, depth of fruit flavor and tannins as a central core.

82871,US,"Hews to the Hanzell style, which is almost old-fashioned in this age of ripely opulent Pinot Noirs. This one's tight as a drum in tannins and acids, a quivery, nervously wound wine. Yet it's quite rich and complex, with a tapestry of cherry, red licorice, tobacco, Canadian bacon, dusty Indian spice and buttered toast flavors.  Needs 7–8 years in the cellar, and, based on tastings of very old Hanzell, should slowly unfold through the 2020s.",Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard,93,145.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
82875,Argentina,"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights; drink now through 2013.",Marchiori Vineyard,93,190.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Cobos
82998,US,"Another fabulous Cardinale, better than the 2007 but short of the perfect 2006.

82999,US,"We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion. Fine acidity and rich tannins provide structure, and although the wine is silky enough to enjoy now, you really want to give it 6–8 years.",West Block,96,100.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
83000,US,"Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak.

83008,US,"Rich, vital and dramatically layered, offering tiers of ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. The oak is sweetly toasted and fine.

83166,US,"Dark as a moonless midnight, dry as dust, with hard-edged tannins, this Cabernet is almost undrinkable now in its extreme youth. It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.",Reserve Speciale,92,110.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
83171,Argentina,"Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine. Argentino in 2007 is deep and dark like always, with coconut and cassis aromas preceding a sweet, ultrarich palate that's teetering on candied. Quite oaky and chocolaty as well, with brown sugar and depth to the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Argentino,92,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
83188,Spain,"This Cabernet-Monastrell blend tips the scales at 15.5% and asks you straight out: how big do you like your red wines? It is smoky, sultry and massive, with spicy boysenberry aromas, a deep, syrupy palate and plodding flavors of molasses, roasted berry, cedar plank and herbs. Bullish but drinkble now and over the next few years; probably not one for the cellar.",,92,140.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,El Nido
83191,US,"Pricy, but flashy, a Cabernet to pour into your best crystal stemware. It's elaborate in blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, with a tug of minerals.

83282,US,"The style of this wine may not be for everyone, but there's no doubt that it's a great success for its type. Dry and full bodied, it shows intensely concentrated blackberry, cassis and mineral flavors, wrapped into huge, thick tannins.

83285,US,"A sumptuous Bordeaux-style blend, this is based on Cabernet Sauvignon, showing plenty of class and elegance.

Best after 2016.",Episode,94,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Terlato
83289,US,"Bitter tannins lock this wine down in mouth-numbing astringency. Below the tannins is incredibly pure fruit, by way of blackberry and plum flavors. It has firm minerality, like a lick of stone, while oak aging brings its own flavor profile as well as additional wood tannins. This is nowhere near ready, so give it at least eight years in the cellar.",,94,350.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lokoya
83290,US,"This falls midway between the spectacular '08 and the elegant '07. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, its grapes were grown in St. Helena. The wine shows softly lush tannins and deep, complex flavors of red fruit, berry, licorice, cocoa and mineral that easily stand up to 100% new French oak. Don't open it until at least 2018, and it should develop for many years afterward.",Profile,94,165.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale
83295,US,"This low production (365 cases) Pinot Noir is a selection from the winery's various vineyards. It's an enormous wine, intricately layered with blackberry, cherry, cola, mushroom, pine needle, bacon and toasty oak. It's also very acidic, and the tannins close in fast, giving the wine an astringency that lasts through the finish. This needs time; hold until 2016, at the very least.",Ten Degrees,94,110.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
83298,US,"Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time.

83301,US,"This shows the tightly knit tannins of Spring Mountain, and is unapologetic about them, demanding that you cellar this wine. It's very finely constructed, with brisk acidity and a firm, grounding minerality below the intensely concentrated core of blackberry and cassis flavors. It should hit its stride in 8-10 years and go for well beyond that.",,94,350.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lokoya
83302,France,"This is heavy on the wood, but it's so rich in fruit as well.

83465,Spain,"Dark as night and full of black fruit aromas, this old-vines newbie is rocking it. The nose is packed with jammy blackberry, leather and fine spice aromas, and the palate is pillowy despite big tannins. Smoky, swarthy flavors of blackberry, cassis and stewed black cherry roll, and it's chewy, creamy and chocolaty on the finish. Expensive but a high-quality contender.",,92,100.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo,Ramiro's Wine Cellar

83536,France,"A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard.

83538,France,"A glorious Champagne, now at the peak of its powers and maturity.

83539,France,"Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more.",RD Brut Champagne,97,260.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
83540,France,"Exceptionally rich and dense, an exceptional wine that reveals itself in layers, from the first fruit attack to the mineral texture and the way it gradually fills the mouth.

83544,Italy,"Bravo! The Brunate cru has awarded Vietti with a stellar product: a wine that is unusually dark and plush with impressive intensity and crafted aromas of black fruit, spice, earth, licorice, balsam and gianduia chocolate-hazelnut spread.

83548,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",,96,175.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin

83635,France,"A powerful evocation of the weight of a Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Cru, this wine shows as much tannin as fruit.

83816,Argentina,"This single-vineyard Malbec proves once again that Achaval-Ferrer does not specialize in textbook wines.

83820,France,"Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex.

83825,France,"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast.

83827,France,"As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity.

83838,Italy,"Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more.",Rocche,95,130.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
83841,France,"A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity.

Drink after 2017.",La Serra,95,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Eugenio Bocchino
83847,Italy,"Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly.

83900,New Zealand,"Less weighty than some of the other top-rated Hawke's Bay Syrahs, Homage relies on complexity rather than raw power.

Amazingly complex and fresh on the neverending finish.",Rare,100,300.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
84037,US,"Depth and texture dominate; it's all whole-cluster fruit, aged in new barriques. This fine follow-up to the 2006 features a little more delicacy, with a lovely floral component and some earth. The depth is astonishing in the weight and texture and the way the wine plays out across the palate.

84052,France,"Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer.",Le Méal Ermitage,95,270.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
84056,US,"Shows the Bacchus profile of ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, pure, strong tannins and exceptional balance. It's a dry, classically structured Cabernet of enormous complexity and interest.

84123,France,"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",Brut Rosé,94,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
84124,France,"With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity.

84132,US,"Such are the tannins in this 100% Cab that it demands cellar time. It's really shut down and astringent in youth, which emphasizes the dryness. But it's very fine, with a solid core of ripe black cherry fruit that will express its sweetness when the tannins melt away. Winemaker Amy Aiken is really showing her stuff with this polished ager.

84147,Italy,"Barolo La Serra from Gianni Voerzio would make a perfect companion to pulled pork smoked over hardwood charcoal.

84197,US,"The '09 Continuum proves the adage that a great winery will produce fine wine even in a compromised vintage—such as 2009, with its cool conditions and rain during harvest.

It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar.

The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked.

85483,France,"Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants. The structure, though, pushes the wine into a mineral direction, adding tightness and toast to the ebullient fruit.

85600,US,"From the winery's estate vineyard, on the eastern side of the Oakville appellation, this Cab is incredibly lush and delicious.

85603,Spain,"Toasty and black as midnight on the nose, this has mineral-driven, tight-grained oak, with a blackberry aroma that won't quit.

85609,US,"The Grand Ciel Vineyard seems to be coming into maturity, and this shows impressive depth and complexity. Infused with flavors of rock and light herb,with hints of stem, anise, coffee and cocoa, it nonetheless remains firmly anchored in ripe black cherry and cassis.

85665,France,"This is concentrated, with big, firm tannins that are still covering the red berry fruits.

85772,France,"A big, rounded wine that brings in power, concentration and weight. Perhaps too much weight: a huge mouthful of fruit and tannins. It really needs many years to come together with all this punch and rich texture.",,93,214.0,Burgundy,Chapelle-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
85779,US,"Seems very well made, with impressive flavors of blackberries and black currants, touched with smoky oak, and encased in firm tannins. Texture and balance are everything in these Cabs, and this wine is not lacking in either. The tannic astringency strongly suggests midterm aging, through 2013, at least.",,93,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Picazo
85781,France,"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present.

85783,Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful.

85787,France,"Jayer-Gilles has vines on the lower slopes of the Echézeaux vineyard, hence the subtitle of the wine, “du Dessous.” The wine has finesse, but with structure, and is impressively powered with tannins (although with a nagging green bean character as it opens up), spice, a definite amount of toast as well as freshly acid red fruits.",Echézeaux du Dessous,93,259.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
85805,US,"Sweet and ripe in jammy cherries and blackberries, and framed in sweet, rich tannins, this Cabernet seems a bit direct and unidimensional now.

85845,Chile,"Chile's most expensive wine is excellent, and with only 50 cases being imported it's definitely a collector's edition. The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas. The palate is racy and tannic, and the flavors of plum, cassis, blackberry, chocolate, prune and fig are elevated. A tough and ribald wine that will be at its best from 2012–2015.",Viñedo Chadwick,92,260.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
85846,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together.

85881,Spain,"Rich and voluptuous on the bouquet, this has coconut, ripe blackberry and leather aromas.

85887,Spain,"Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather.

86138,US,"This is a very nice Cabernet that feels rich in the mouth, a wine that will have everybody remarking on its smooth, velvety texture. Taste-wise, it shows an olive tinge to the red and black cherry fruit, with a beautiful overlay of smoky oak.

86142,Italy,"Here's a Barolo that lives up to its “riserva” status thanks to aged aromas of old spice, leather, black mineral, root beer, tar and menthol-like intensity. There are some earthy, dusty tones on the finish and the wine imparts firm, ripe tannins in the mouth.

86188,US,"This is tough in tannins and somewhat rustic now, in the way of young Monte Bellos. There's not much to recommend opening it anytime soon, especially if you're a fan of the modern style of accessible lusciousness. But it is rich and minerally, with a fine core of black fruit. Monte Bello Estate (not to be confused with Ridge's similarly-named Estate Monte Bello, which costs far less) is a wine that historically ages very well, and 2009 was a pretty good vintage, so you're safe cellaring it for at least 10 years.",Monte Bello Estate,92,150.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ridge
86367,France,"Kreydenweiss' unusually oxidative vinification methods are better suited to making a sweet wine such as this Vendanges Tardives, where we expect more savory flavors and less fresh fruit.

86736,Spain,"A fine wine but not up to par with previous renditions. This vintage has proprietary blueberry, floral and jammy aromas, while the palate is narrow and a touch sheering and tannic, with jammy dark berry flavors and not a lot of variety or complexity.

88256,US,"A late release, very limited-production reserve, this still carries a youthful bite and shows a strong pine and herb component. It's solid and full, but a bit blocky, and fades rather quickly.",Cathy's Reserve,88,100.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller
88328,France,"There is a tightness to this wine, initially softened by ripe fruit, then coming through in the form of dark tannins, a stony terroir-driven layer of dryness, firmness and a potentially powerful structure. There's no question, this needs to age—five years or more.",,92,155.0,Burgundy,Corton-Bressandes,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Laleure-Piot
88331,France,"This is both rich and firmly structured. The tannins are the most prominent element here, dominating the black fruits and offering a texture that is dense and dry. Black berry and plum juice flavors are joined by bitter chocolate and rich spice. For aging.",Aux Perdrix Premier Cru,92,120.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Pinot Noir,Domaine des Perdrix
88334,France,"Rich and smoky, this is developing into a deliciously ripe wine. The tannins are already in balance with the plum juice flavors of the fruit, giving sweetness as well as power. Dark, intense, but very accessible.",Les Vaucrains Premier Cru,92,108.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Pinot Noir,Bertrand Ambroise
88430,US,"At the age of four years, this Cab strikes you as very fruity and also sharp. It has jammy cherry, blackberry, black currant and baker's chocolate flavors that taste like they have a squirt of lime juice for tartness. The oak overlay is strong in char and vanilla, but balanced. The overall impression is of power and elegance, but immaturity. Try holding until 2013, and could develop for many years.",Lot 1,90,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
88543,France,"Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works.

Serve this unusual wine by itself or with Indian fare.",Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru,88,105.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Marc Kreydenweiss
88635,France,"Beautiful fresh raspberry flavors appear with tannins showing a density and dryness, but the essential is the perfume and the freshness.

88636,Italy,"Thick, black and impenetrable, this is one of the most densely extracted wines you will ever encounter. Despite its extreme size, it maintains a fresh, delicate character throughout thanks to the obvious quality of the fruit.

88646,France,"As rich and opulent as its red wine pair, this is ripe and soft, a swirl of velvet tempered by citrus and sweet and fresh acidity. The toast of the wood is only just evident, its presence felt as much as tasted. Despite its richness, it does remain wedded to Burgundy, as evidenced by the tight, steely finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,92,102.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin

88920,France,"In the creamy Chablis style that is a Drouhin signature, this wine is ripe, the fresh acidity of the appellation showing behind pears flavors.

88936,France,"A firm, solid, foursquare style of wine, showing firm tannins and big, bold fruit. There is a dense dryness here surrounded by rich fruit that still shows some austerity.

89013,Italy,"Prunotto's Barolo from the Bussia cru delivers ripe and jammy tones of strawberry preserves and blackberry pie that sit heavy over Nebbiolo's characteristically ethereal aromas. This wine will appeal to those who enjoy a bigger, bolder style of Barolo that finishes with rich, succulent fruit.",Bussia,89,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Prunotto
89023,Italy,"This expression of Barolo from the Bussia cru opens with fleshy pulp, rich concentration and very intense aromas of cola, cherry, humus, licorice and grated ginger.

89231,France,"Initial high toast aromas soften to bring out spice and yellow fruits. The palate shows more fruit, but still gives layered wood over the citrus, apricot and final acidity.

89246,France,"Corton-Charlemagne should have weight, and this wine has weight. It sits plumply in the glass, a big spice- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, layered with toast and ripeness.

89399,US,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",,100,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale
89542,France,"A powerful layer of tannin is the initial dominant element here. The fruit, black plum skins and red cherries, is behind this curtain of dryness.

89616,US,"A good 100% Cabernet, with complex, pleasant cherry, blackberry and oak flavors. Quite tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, and very full-bodied.

89635,France,"The Palmes d'Or rosé is always distinctive, not always for the good. However, this 2003 vintage shows well, with ripe cherry flavors, yeast and a soft, open texture.

89640,US,"The 2006 flagship Cabernet from Quilceda Creek is a massive wine that has just begun to emerge from its slumber. When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish.",,98,125.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek
89643,Italy,"Consistently among Italy's top-scoring wines, this vintage of the celebrated Ornellaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a gorgeous expression of the very best of European enology.

89653,Australia,"The 2007 Astralis impresses for its combination of power and nuance. It's dark and almost tarry in concentration, but floral and bright at the same time.

Best from 2014–2025.",Astralis,95,225.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
89655,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",Pastorale Vineyard,95,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
89656,US,"To call this a big Cab would be an understatement. It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak.

89666,France,"Despite the 100% new wood, this wine (GC stands for Grand Cru) is beautifully restrained.

89975,US,"Very dark, dramatic, opulent, but young. Opens with brooding aromas of black currants, cassis and spices, and turns dense in tannins in the mouth.

The release date is Spring 2010.",Pluribus,94,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
89976,US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar. Try after 2013.",Pastorale Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
89987,US,"Starts with a beautiful ruby color that's so pretty and gleaming. Appeals right away for its rich, attractive sour cherry candy, vanilla and anise aromas and flavors that are well-integrated with smoky oak.

A well-made, elegant wine of place that needs time. 2012–2018.",Melbury,93,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
89995,US,"An enormously rich, extracted Cabernet, with dramatically layered blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors, liberally accented with smoky new oak.

90402,Spain,"Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody.

90419,France,"From organic vineyards, this wine shows rich fruit and generous red berry flavors. There is ripe sweetness as well, with soft tannins from the fruit.

90438,US,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex. It's great Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but that high alcohol may limit its ageability.",IX Estate,99,290.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Colgin
90439,US,"There are incredible aromatics on this Cabernet. It's powerful yet subtle (how can that be?), all about sweet, crushed summer blackberries and pure cassis liqueur. Elaborate oak, in the form of buttered toast, is perfectly in balance, never overshadowing the fruit. The tannins are dry, rich and smooth, defining Napa elegance, grace and beauty. World class, dramatic and just about perfect, this gets better and better as it breathes in the glass.

90447,US,"Rich and smooth in tannins, with some sharpness through the finish, this shows masses of ripe blackberries and dark chocolate. A bit of time in the glass reprises and accentuates the chocolaty richness. Despite its power, this is refined and high toned, a serious cellar candidate. Give it 10–15 years.",,96,335.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bryant Family
90576,Italy,"Here's a beautifully executed 50-50 blend of Merlot from Avignonesi and Sangiovese from Capannelle with soft layers of cherry and blackberry packed tight between spice, cola and mesquite.

90713,France,"This is already delicious, a wine that opens with the juiciest fruit, great wafts of perfumed raspberry juice followed by vivid acidity.

90726,US,"You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now.",,95,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Sirena
90728,Italy,"One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic.

90732,Italy,"Vintner Marco Caprai is the man who has tamed the tannic, unruly beast that is Sagrantino. Having carefully aged for two years in oak, this has become deeply elegant and sophisticated.

Age for 10 years or more.",25 Anni,94,100.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Arnaldo Caprai
90733,US,"Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crème de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades.",Black Diamonds,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Parallel
90735,US,"Dark and saturated in color, this has earthy and meaty aromas like bloody, rare steak and charred bone—that sort of proteinous spirit.

90886,Italy,"Extremely elegant but also understated, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese needs a few minutes in the glass before it reveals itself fully.

Throughout it all, those beautifully pristine pepper tones truly define this wine.",Suisassi,92,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Syrah,Duemani
91021,US,"Flashy and delicious, this just blows your mind. It's like the essence of the ripest, purest blackberries, with a note of crème de cassis and the sweet appeal of melted dark chocolate.

91036,France,"From a new winery that's bottle-aging its wines prior to release, this is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Because the vineyards straddle multiple appellations, it carries a modest Vin de Pays de Vaucluse label, but this is serious stuff.

91046,US,"This starts out a bit coarse, with strong tannins that have a rough-edged feeling. It's very rich in blackberries and black currants, but showing more power than elegance.

While the alcohol is high, it may easily develop bottle complexity over the next 10–15 years.",,93,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Villa del Lago
91311,Australia,"There's a lifted quality to the bouquet of this wine that's slightly distracting, but also plenty of cherry fruit. In fact, it's the somewhat monolithic nature of the fruit that's most disappointing; for a wine of this lauded reputation there needs to be more evidence of complexity. Some of that will no doubt come with bottle age, but it's hard to see now. Try after 2014.",Graveyard Vineyard,89,125.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Brokenwood
91332,US,"This is by far the most expensive of Duckhorn's new releases, but it's not the best to drink now. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's easy to imagine the winemaker singling out the most tannic and concentrated lots, but what you get is, simply, a very tannic wine. There's a gigantic core of blackberry and black currant fruit, but it's hard to appreciate because of the astringency.

91497,US,"Not very pleasant now due to the sharpness and bitterness of the texture, as well as the wood tannins that come from aging in 100% new oak. The flavors are of primary fruit blackberries, cherries and black currants.

This richness finishes drily, but the wine is very tannic, giving it a lock-down astringency. Needs time. Best after 2011, and through 2015 or so.",The Montelena Estate,90,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Montelena
91922,Italy,"This creamy Tuscan Chardonnay shares many characteristics with its distant cousin in California. It shows a decidedly New World style, with aromas of vanilla cream, dried apricot, honey, peach cobbler and crème brûlée. The finish is marked with a spicy toasted-oak intensity.",Monteverro,92,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Chardonnay,Monteverro
91926,US,"A new wine from superstar winemaker Heidi Barrett, and the label is one of the coolest ever. It's extraordinarily rich and opulent, with a tapestry-like silky complexity. The blackberry, cherry and olive flavors are very ripe, yet it finishes wonderfully dry.",Art Bus,92,115.0,California,Calistoga,Napa,Red Blend,La Sirena
92097,Australia,"Made in a very ripe style, this wine's traces of raisiny character detract slightly from its velvety, suede-like texture and ample concentration. It's still admirable for its concentration and richness, but some will find it overripe. Drink now-2015.",Roennfeldt Road Goose-yard Block,90,100.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Schubert
92436,France,"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years.",Cristal Brut,98,289.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer
92437,France,"Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.",Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut,97,275.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger
92438,US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017.",Estate Bottled,96,125.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
92441,US,"Still young, chewy and textural, this stands as a classic Washington 2005 red—lusciously laden with mixed red and black berries, generous and deep; dense and jammy. The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking.",,96,115.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek
92443,France,"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.",Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs,96,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Salon
92448,France,"Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts.

92450,France,"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine. It is more open than the great 1996, more generous, giving some mature toast and nut flavors, but still retaining ripe apricots and mulberry. In the Jacquesson style, this is very dry, but its richness keeps it well in balance.",Brut,95,165.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Jacquesson et Fils
92453,US,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries. One hundred percent new French oak is completely in accord with the size.

Worth aging, it will be even better in 3–4 years.",Dom Pérignon Brut,95,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
92455,France,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness.",Brut,95,350.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
92496,France,"Initially spicy, this wine then develops an awkward barnyard character that is hard to shake off. The tannins are firm, dry, but sit at one side of the wine, leaving bitter fruit.

92499,Spain,"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors.

It's rude now, with oaky, grapey flavors of black raspberry marmalade and Dr. Pepper cola. While it's dry and crisp and interesting, it's awkward. Is it an ager?

Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Profile,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale
92742,Italy,"Here's a beautifully aged Amarone from an excellent vintage. Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop.

92745,France,"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass.

92916,US,"A perfect score has to be considered in the context of its region. Shafer's 2004 Hillside Select is tremendous as a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon that competes with its peers at the highest levels. It's always a fabulous wine, but in warm 2004, Shafer's amphitheater vineyard sheltered the grapes, ripening them to perfection yet protecting the “iron fist in a velvet glove” structure that André Tchelistcheff defined as Stags Leap. This 100% Cabernet is tremendous in cassis, black currant and mocha flavors, and the 100% new French oak provides perfect additions of smoke and caramel.

94523,US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power.

It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets.

94808,US,"Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy.

98009,US,"A textbook, modern Napa Cabernet that offers plenty of varietal pleasure, with blackberry, cassis, chocolate and oak flavors liberally framed in fine sweet oak, and wrapped into luxurious tannins. A little too obvious in its charms, but it could surprise down the road.",,89,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Palmaz
98051,US,"Plenty of flavor in this extremely ripe wine. Bursting with blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it's clearly delicious. Yet it's a very soft wine. Makes you wish it were firmer in structure, to support all that decadent flavor.

98441,US,"This multivintage bottling is extraordinarily rich in orange fruit. You'll find complex layers of smoky butter, yeasty brioche, vanilla and toasted oak.

98442,US,"Astonishingly rich, this is everything you want a Chardonnay to be. It's fantastically concentrated in pineapple, guava, green apple, pear and lime fruits; it's creamy and suave in lees influence; and it's brisk in acidity, despite undergoing malolactic fermentation.

98443,US,"This is so charming now, it's hard to keep from drinking it. But it also has the dynamic tension to age well. Chimney Rock enters a whole new ballgame with its 2009 releases, which can stand against almost anything in Napa Valley.

98445,US,"Delicious, stunning and dramatic, this varietal Cabernet shows exquisite balance of its many parts.

98447,US,"Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabs aren't always fabulous, because so many wineries source its fruit, but Knights Bridge has a great track record. This release is their best ever. Dry and soft in the mouth, it's drinkable now, yet so firm are the tannins that it will easily age. As for the flavors, they're incredibly complex in blackberries, black currant and licorice.

Made from 86% Chardonnay and 14% Pinot Noir, it most certainly needs some time in the cellar, as it's scoury right now.

It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself.

98945,Spain,"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas.

Give the tannins several years to smooth out before drinking.",Masseria,92,110.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
99563,US,"This is the most expensive of the winery's new Cabs. It's also the fruitiest and most in need of time in the cellar. Right now, it's a candied blast of blackberries and cherries. The tannins are sweet and chunky, and the oak isn't integrated with everything else. It's awkward. But it should develop for a good 6–8 years, maybe even longer. The score reflects its potential.",Tomahawk Vineyard,92,110.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
99570,France,"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.",Assemblage Brut,92,101.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard
99585,US,"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.",Winderlea Vineyard,92,105.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
99590,US,"Directly from the bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is tight and closed. The tannins and acids dominate, despite a wealth of sweet fruit flavors like blackberry, cherry and cassis. In all respects, especially structurally, it's a pedigreed wine. Have faith in its future, and cellar it for eight years.",Lake William Estate Grown Cave Fermented,92,155.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Jarvis
99596,US,"Using grapes sourced from estate vines planted in 1972, this wine is comparable, in its subtlety and delicate elegance, to an old-vine Zinfandel. Strawberry and spice run through the core, with brambly highlights and excellent balance. The wine is still a bit closed, so give it a good decanting, or leave it alone for a few more years.",Quarter Mile Lane Vineyard,92,105.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
99869,Australia,"This voluptuous, fleshy Shiraz seamlessly blends superripe berries with vanilla, coffee and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied, with a creamy texture that persists through the lengthy finish. Between the touch of warmth and ultrasoft tannins, smart consumers will want to drink this over the near term—now through 2015.",Ox,91,105.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Andrew Hardy
100112,Spain,"Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.",VS Reserva,91,100.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Red Blend,Val Sotillo
100131,Australia,"One of the Hunter Valley's top bottlings, Brokenwood's Graveyard Vineyard is still marked by hints of toasty oak at this young stage in its evolution. Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025.",Graveyard Vineyard,91,125.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Brokenwood
100134,Australia,"This is one tightly wound Shiraz. There's cedar and spice on the nose, but the plum fruit is balled up inside, needing time to emerge. Still, the spice notes are impressive, ranging from sage to peppercorn, and the structure is impeccable. Probably worth trying again in 2016.",Mount Edelstone Vineyard,91,110.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
100306,France,"The limestone soil gives this wine a mineral intensity that sits well with the smoky, meaty character of the Pinot Noir. The red fruits are full, laced with spice, smoky wood from 14-month aging, giving a rounded, rich satisfying finish.",En Grands Champs,90,164.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Alphonse Mellot
100312,Australia,"I suspect the Cyril Henschke Cabernets show better after additional bottle age, but on release they are invariably difficult to read. There is no denying the attractive scents of mint, smoke and cassis in the 2004, nor the ripe plum and cassis-driven flavors, but the wine seems tight and reined in on the palate. Try after 2012.",Cyril Henschke,90,110.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Henschke
100417,US,"A very good, rich Cabernet, softly dry and tannic and stuffed with blackberry, black currant, olive, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. Feels lush and powerful, but not particularly impressive given the wine's reputation and price. Could be a sleeper. Cellar it and see where it goes.",S.L.V.,88,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
100491,Chile,"Mild, earthy and composed on the nose, this has rich berry and cassis aromas and not too much herbal essence. It feels voluminous and chewy, with medicinal black fruit, spice cake and nutmeg flavors, followed by a deep, almost-syrupy finish.",Kai,91,155.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Errazuriz
100604,US,"Rich and soft, this Cab hails from a great vineyard in Rutherford. It's dry, but tastes as sweet as a blackberry, chocolate and caramel pastry. The alcohol is high, yet balance and harmony characterize the mouthfeel. Drink now–2011.",Sacrashe Vineyard,90,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Delectus
100611,France,"A wonderful explosion of red berry fruits marks this wine as something special. The fruits lead to a smooth-textured, wood-aged wine that brings in an array of spices and a depth of ripe flavors, with finishing sweet acidity.",Génération XIX,90,194.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Alphonse Mellot
100612,US,"The alcohol is a shocking 16%, but the truth is this wine is deliciously drinkable, in a soft, velvety way. Shows decadent flavors of blackberry essence, cherry tart, dark chocolate and cedar, grounded by earthy notes of sage. Very rich and exotic, almost a liqueur. Drink now.",Memento Estate,90,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
100706,Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.",Treinta y Dos,90,150.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
100779,Hungary,"Heady with notes of orange marmalade and lavender, this honeyed Tokaji is remarkably brisk. Its showstopping acidity shines through the layers of caramel and orange cream. Effortlessly long on the palate, it is not at all cloying.",Betsek Aszú 6 Puttonyos,91,104.0,Tokaj,,,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji
100788,France,"Seductively light in color, this is based on Pinot Noir. It has a fine balance and a touch of toast. The fresh red-fruit and citrus flavors harmonize into a complex whole. Like many Bollinger Champagnes, it's a delicious, full-bodied selection that's best suited for food.",Brut Rosé,91,110.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
100890,US,"A young, distinguished Cab, made in the modern style of softness, ripeness and apparent sweetness. Floods the mouth with blackberries, black cherries, anise, chocolate, pepper and smoky oak. Should improve over the next 6-8 years.",Charlie's Patch,90,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Hands
100984,US,"Not drinkable now or anytime soon, due to the tannins. Scours the mouth with a hard astringency, like the Cabernets of a generation or two ago. There are rich, ripe flavors of blackberries and currants swimming below those depths, as well as lots of sweet, smoky oak. But you'd need a crystal ball to know what this Bordeaux blend will do in 10 or 15 years.",Black Label Estate Grown,90,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Turnbull
100995,Australia,"From an ancient vineyard, this full-bodied, slighly dusty-textured Shiraz boasts attractive scents of mixed berries, but also a slightly tarry note. Flavors run in a similar vein, adding in hints of espresso and vanilla, while the finish develops an ever so slightly gritty, bitter note. Hope that mellows with age and stow this away until 2014.",Attunga 1865,90,235.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
101004,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",,90,142.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
101211,France,"From clay and flint soil, this Pinot Noir has delicious up-front ripe raspberry and red berry fruit flavors laced with nutmeg, a light layer of toast and bright acidity to finish.",La Demoiselle,89,144.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Alphonse Mellot
101223,US,"Feels old-fashioned in the dry, rugged tannins and herb-infused blackberry and currant flavors. Good, but curiously one-dimensional, which leads to the question of ageability. Hard to tell. Try after 2012.",,87,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silver Oak
101390,France,"With a strong, mousse-like feel in the mouth, this is a lively offering. It's yellow fruit is layered with toastiness. It has a rich feel, very much in the Billiot style, and a complex, compact character. It is ready to drink. Disgorged October 2011.",Cuvée Laetitia Brut,90,106.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,H. Billiot Fils
101460,France,"A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000.",,97,190.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases
101467,France,"This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins. Flavors of bitter chocolate are dominant, heavy fruits, blackberries and texture that fills the mouth with dark, dense flavors. Big in all senses.",,94,190.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases
101474,Germany,"So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades.",Trockenbeerenauslese Goldlack,97,486.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
101475,Germany,"The wonderful minerality imparted by the Doctor vineyard is somehow able to keep this intensely sweet, rich wine from being heavy or cloying. Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",Berncasteler Doctor Beerenauslese Goldkap,96,160.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef)
101477,Australia,"This Muscat is the color of dark coffee, with a greenish inflection at the rim, showing the high average age of the blend. It is incredibly rich and sweet—it pretty much oozes across the palate with intense flavors of molasses and dried dates before finishing long, long, long. A wine you can still taste minutes after spitting or swallowing.",Rare,95,300.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
101479,US,"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward.",,95,125.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa
101481,France,"Full-bodied, lush and sweet, yet despite the presence of ample botrytis, the wine retains a sense of varietal character in its lychee-scented aromas. Dried apricot and pineapple flavors linger for a long time on the mouthwatering finish. Delicious now, and should age well for at least 10 years. The 2001 and 2002 vintages are also currently available, and not far behind in quality.",Sélection de Grains Nobles,94,210.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Hugel
101485,Germany,"This winery has turned out a couple of terrific BAs in 2006 as the family focuses its efforts on its estate wines. Pear, peach, pineapple and spice notes lead the way, garnished by hints of dried apricots in this rich, viscous offering. Finishes long and mouthwatering, not cloying at all—a remarkable achievement in a wine this sweet.

101534,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
101603,Australia,"Intensely toasty on the nose, along with powerful menthol notes that persist from start to finish.

101762,France,"Hugel, a firm known for its dry-styled table wines, can make killer sweet wines as well, deftly illustrated by this example.

101765,US,"Made in a very ripe style, this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is fat and rich in cherries, blackberries, chocolate, cola and cedar flavors. The soft density is partly the result of relatively high alcohol, but the wine wears it well. Shows a good balance of alcohol, acids, fruit, oak and firm, dusty tannins, and should age well through 2012.",Reserve,93,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
101771,Germany,"For a beerenauslese, usually dominated by honeyed fruit, this shows a surprising degree of stony minerality, which helps to balance the rich, sweet flavors of orange marmalade, dried apricots and honey. Viscous in texture, yet the citrus and mineral notes keep it from becoming cloying. Drink now–2035.",Abtsberg Beerenauslese,93,204.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
101772,US,"At its best Rubicon stuns with power and richness. In lesser vintages (which are usually hotter ones) the wine, which is largely Cabernet Sauvignon, can be raisiny. While 2004 was a warm year, diligent viticulture paid off, resulting in an opulent wine with the purest expression of crushed cherries and blackberries, and oak-inspired hints of nougat and caramel. Fairly aggressive in tannins now, it should begin to open by 2008 and drink well for a decade.",Rubicon,93,125.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate
101773,US,"This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage.",Pickett Road,93,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
101776,Germany,"With scents of dried apricots and superconcentrated pear nectar, one sniff suggests this is going to be a sumptuously sweet treat. And it is. Pear, melon and spice flavors linger elegantly on the finish, ending long and sweet.",Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese,93,395.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
101779,US,"The vineyard is source of high-quality fruit, but also intense mountain tannins that require time to melt. Under those tannins is dramatically rich black currant and carob fruit flavor, easily big enough to sustain 100% new French oak. By 2009 this 100% Cab should begin to soften and sweeten, and it will drink beautifully for at least six more years.",Hillside Reserve,93,108.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
101780,Australia,"Befitting its age, this wine is dark coffee in color, changing to greenish at the rim. Flavors are malty and molasses-like, accented by scents of burnt coffee and sugar.

101781,Germany,"Rich and thickly textured, this wine features intense botrytis aromas of dried apricots, backing them up with flavors of honey and orange marmalade.

102089,US,"A delicious Cabernet that managed to finesse the heat of the vintage better than many other wineries.

102360,Germany,"Viscous, almost oily in texture, this is several vintages older than most of the recent samples, yet seems so unevolved that it's not out of place.

105226,Spain,"Varietal Graciano will never fit into the mold of “tried and true,” but this 2004 from top-level producer Contino shows the grape in its most positive light. The nose is natural, with hints of cola and ripe berries. The feel is brawny and intense, with semi-searing acids offset by ripe tannins. Finishes well, with a cleansing wave of red fruit and citrusy flavors. More of a novelty than anything, but a fine wine in and of itself.",Single Vineyard,91,138.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Graciano,Contino

105513,US,"This ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.",Reserve,91,105.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Nicholas Cole Cellars

105701,US,"Elaborately rich, this has a velvety smooth texture due to its refined tannins. It's slowly picking up bottle character, with the primary fruit flavors of blackberries and cherries mellowing as it picks up olive and earth notes.

106221,US,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal.

106223,US,"So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot.

106225,US,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience.

106227,Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Leiwener Laurentiuslay Beerenauslese,96,175.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
106228,France,"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish.",Legend Vintage,96,380.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Maury,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
106229,US,"This dramatic, compulsively good Cabernet is the first Howell Mountain Cab ever from the winery. It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control.

106500,US,"So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor. The blackberry and cassis flavors have an edge of chocolate, and the deliciousness is compounded by superbly ripe, sculpted tannins and a long but thoroughly dryfinish.

106501,France,"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying.

106512,US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak.

106522,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't.

106556,US,"This is one of the least drinkable of Pride Mountain's new red wines, simply because it needs time. It's all primary fruit vs. oak now, with unintegrated blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors fighting it out with smoky caramelized wood and vanilla. Tannins lurk in the background, ready to embrace both sides. Made solidly in the modern cult style of extreme ripeness and high alcohol, it's a compelling wine that should come into its own sometime late in 2010, and drink well for 6–8 years.",Reserve,94,125.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain

106819,France,"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout.

Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.",Christopher's,93,100.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
108495,Argentina,"Electric purple in color, with a concentrated, deep nose of mineral, black plum and toast. The palate is lush and giant, but balanced perfectly by natural acidity and fine tannins. Huge berry and plum flavors are dense, and vanilla, coffee and herb flavors grace the long finish. Drink from 2010 through 2016.",Finca Bella Vista,93,112.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer
108682,US,"The price is prerelease; it will soar on the aftermarket. This is very great Harlan. It pours dark and saturated, and the tannins are big and sturdy, not aggressive, but sweet and finely ground. Still, they give a hardness to the immaculately ripe fruit that mandates cellaring. The flavors of currants, blackberries, plums, chocolate and cedar are lush, deep and long-lasting, but just a part of the balanced appeal of this young wine. It really defines the exquisite tension between power and elegance. Best after 2008, then for many years.",,98,350.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Harlan Estate
108684,US,"The '04 Maiden is very close to Harlan Estate in quality. The Maiden is a touch less elegant; but it is such a wholesome wine, so succulent in blackberry, cassis, licorice, and roasted cedar. The tannins are so regal—even the slight prickle of acidity works for polish. So beautiful now, it's hard to know when to suggest drinking it, but this should easily be a 10–15 year wine.",,97,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The Maiden
108685,US,"Brilliant aromatics here, just stupendously attractive. Among the sweetest and most approachable of Harlan's current stable, it's also complex and ageworthy. Fairly tannic now, with a refined sandpapery grittiness coating pure flavors of ripe cherries, plums and blackberries and their associated liqueurs. The finish is so long, balanced and harmonious. It's hard to imagine that this won't be one to age 12–15 years.",St. Eden,96,210.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
108927,US,"Awesome Cabernet from this esteemed vineyard in Oakville. Defines the modern Napa style in the perfectly ripe black currant and blackberry fruit, and the ultra-refined tannins. Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla. Should evolve slowly through 2020, but only 75 cases were produced.",Beckstoffer To Kalon,97,130.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alpha Omega

108941,US,"A dark, rich wine, this opens with ripe, sweet aromas of fresh blackberries, cedar, cigar box, pencil lead and cinnamon. Brings to mind a classified Pauillac, rather hard and tannic now, but sweetly ripe and refined, and very rich in mulberries, cherries, licorice and mocha. A magnificent young wine. Best now, with decanting, through 2012, at least.",Melbury,94,210.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
108942,France,"While it has very bready and yeasty aromas, you can taste the crisp fruits through this.

108945,US,"This is surely the most ambitious Cabernet Franc/Conner Lee wine ever made, and it's priced accordingly. I love the purity, the focus and the way it plays across the palate; it's a real high-wire act. Cab Franc does not lend itself to either elegance or completeness as a varietal grape, which is why it is almost always blended. But here it is the whole show, and it's razzle dazzle all the way. Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is framed in spice and tannin, with a sweetness rarely found. The finishing notes of fresh roasted coffee and mocha linger sensuously in the back of the mouth.

109104,US,"A bit angular and awkward now, with a jagged, sandpapery feeling in the mouth. But the flavors are deep and refined, suggesting baked apples, grilled pears, yeasty, smoked brioche, vanilla bean and spices. Three-quarters Pinot Noir, with the remainder Chardonnay.

109160,Australia,"The flagship of the Clarendon Hills line, this comes from a patch of 80-year-old vines that winemaker Bratasiuk claims routinely provides his best fruit. The 2004 is a stunner, yielding up scents of flowers and spice, framed by hints of vanillin oak. It's dense and amply textured in the mouth, packed with wonderfully expressive blackberry and blueberry fruit, then shows layers of rich tannins on the finish that leave no doubt this needs time in the cellar to show its best.

Drink 2010–2020.",Hickinbotham,96,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
109166,Australia,"If the Liandra is Bratasiuk's Côte-Rôtie, this is the wine he calls “more Hermitage.” And it does have some iron-like, minerally notes to it. But there's more New World suppleness and flesh as well, featuring lush plum and cassis fruit, some hickory-smoked bacon and layers of coffee and cream on the lengthy finish. Approachable now, but should be even better in five years and will easily last for 10–15.",Brookman,95,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
109167,Australia,"Cropped at a measly half ton per acre, this is Clarendon Hills' top Grenache bottling. It's tighter and denser than the other, more flamboyant offerings, needing time in the bottle to develop. For now, it's loaded with wonderfully pure blackberry and cassis fruit, but it promises to develop more complexity over the years; try from 2008–2020. Long and softly tannic on the finish.",Romas,95,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Grenache,Clarendon Hills
109169,US,"In the wine's youth, the aroma of new oak dominates, with that smoky, minty, spicy-char note. But in the mouth the fruit explodes in intensely ripe black currants and milk chocolate.

It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character.

112000,Italy,"Here's a gorgeous Brunello that achieves that ever-so delicate balance of fruit versus menthol notes versus toast to render an unforgettable drinking experience. This is why they say Brunello can't be made in any other part of the world outside this tiny corner of Tuscany: Intense notes of chewy cherry, carob, licorice, almonds, chopped herbs ride over dusty tannins and a long finish.",Vigna del Fiore,92,120.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fattoria dei Barbi
112009,US,"The '04 Spottswoode shows the enormous ripeness of the vintage, with lush currant, blackberry jam, chocolate-covered cherry candy and spice flavors, plus an earthier note of sweet green olive tapenade. For all that voluptuous flavor, the wine maintains great structure. Very good now, it will gradually evolve through at least 2012.",Estate,92,110.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spottswoode
112013,US,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now.

112200,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
112295,Italy,"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.",Case Basse,92,293.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Soldera
112305,Italy,"Sangiovese's naturally warm, earthy tones come straight at you and are surrounded by a pretty frame of red fruit, almond, red apple, plump berry and pipe tobacco.

112381,Italy,"Tight as nails on the nose before it explodes on the palate in a cacophony of cherry, cassis, black plum, tobacco and chocolate. It's like the best cigar and a great red wine rolled into one. Yes, the tannins are hammering and yes, the acidity is forward.

112382,Italy,"Fresh asphalt, burning timber, bitter chocolate, and anything else that connotes “darkness” is what this heavyweight is about. And as rough as that may sound aromatically, on the palate it's polished like a gemstone, with just enough grit and guts to push it forward. The fruit, meanwhile, is sensational, a panoply of black plums and cherries infused with cocoa and vanilla. This offers a clear look into 21st-century Brunello, and the picture is breathtaking.

Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts.

113032,France,"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage.

113038,France,"From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds.

Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar.

113282,France,"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential.

113287,France,"Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength.

113288,France,"This was Chapoutier's initial microcuvée of Hermitage, bottled for the first time in 1989.

114277,US,"Some great Cabs are drinkable when young, while others require patience. This is the latter sort. It's a tough, young wine, dominated by dusty tannins leading to an astringent finish. But it's incredibly fine, showing a balance and grace rare even in Napa Valley. As it warms up and breathes in the glass, it gets even better, giving tantalizing hints of ripe cassis and cherries that now are buried. You could open it now, after decanting, but it should begin to blossom in 2008, and will improve for many years.",Reserve,97,100.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Red Blend,Von Strasser
114278,US,"A masterpiece from this near perfect vintage. Completely ripe, classic and fresh, with oodles of red cherry and blackcurrant flavors that are generously oaked. Amazingly, the wine is still young and tannic. So beautifully structured, so smooth and polished, firm yet soft, just a gorgeous wine. Hold onto it until at least 2012, if you can.",Rubicon,97,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Red Blend,Niebaum-Coppola
114279,US,"The impression is of a young, tannicly closed but enormously promising Cabernet. Floods the mouth with dramatic black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, masses of toasty, caramelized new oak, and a rich, minerally earthiness. For all the power, there's elegance and refinement. If you must drink it now, decant it; best 2008–2015.",Hillside Select,97,190.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer
114280,US,"Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins. Has an acidic bite midpalate that balances the lushness, and will add to the wine's cellar-worthiness. Defines sheer power, but never loses control. Best now and through 2017, at least.",Red Wine,96,500.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Screaming Eagle
114281,US,"Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this firm young wine showcases Napa Cab at its best. It's powerful in cassis and mocha flavors, with complex spice notes. The considerable new oak fits in fine given the wine's size. Extraordinarily smooth and lush, it's beautiful now, but has the  structure to age for a decade. What a beauty.",Claret,96,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Robert Foley
114283,US,"Stunning. Explodes with the most intricately detailed aromas: a perfume of fine smoky oak and ripe black currants. Exudes sheer power, with great weight yet no heaviness. Lush and delicious, but just tannic enough. If you can wait, cellar until 2008, it should hold and improve for many years.",Eisele Vineyard,96,185.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Araujo
114284,US,"More structured than the Melbury, with deeper, firmer tannins: but it's certainly not a tannic, hard wine. It's the quality of the tannins, fine, ripely sweet, intricate. The flavors are enormously rich in blue and black berries, as well as chocolate. Magnificent wine, fleshy, fat, opulent. As delicious as it is now, should age well through 2020.",St. Eden,96,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,BOND
114285,US,"Based on Oakville fruit, Vecina is not quite as fruit-driven as the other two Bond wines. It's a bit backward, with an earthy, mushroomy, soy and balsamic taste alongside the briary berry flavors. Has an almost feral quality that is quite interesting and different. With its big backsplash of tannins, it might age best of the current trio. Drink now–2020.",Vecina,95,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,BOND
114286,US,"Enormously rich, like biting into a warm chocolate truffle with a cherry-blackberry core. Ultrasmooth, a bit soft and melted, but oh, so supple and velvety, with fine, firm tannins. Completely dry and balanced, this is a wine of harmonious complexity.",Melbury,95,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,BOND
114289,US,"Almost black in color. Flavors are of blackberry, cassis, Provençal herbs; the 100% new oak adds rich toast and char notes. Tannins are brilliant, dense and fluffy. Grown at the base of Howell Mountain, this is classic mountain Cab, beautiful now, fleshy and fat, but with a 20-year lifespan.",Herb Lamb Vineyard,95,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Colgin
114293,US,"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.",Cariad,95,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Colgin
114294,Germany,"This wine's intense aromas of honey, oranges and tea seem almost a little roasted or caramelized, but on the palate the flavors are brilliantly defined and focused by vibrant acidity that brighten the bold citrus and honey notes. A  rich and viscous mouthfeel, yet miraculously crisp at the same time; the acids keep the finish echoing in your mouth for a long, long time.",Ürziger Würzgarten Eiswein,95,125.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Peter Nicolay
114296,Italy,"Here is a rock-solid Cabernet embellished by a delicate aromatic embroidery that gives its Piedmont origins away. Dark ruby in color, the nose is perfectly seamless with ripe fruit nuances at the core and generous notes of asphalt, resin and blackberry. The tannins and structure are solid and the wine's enduring persistence can be counted in long, delicious minutes.",Darmagi,94,224.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gaja
114298,Germany,"Insanely priced, but if you love ultrasticky dessert wines, this is one you'll want to try at least once. Shows the merest hint of volatility on the nose, but also striking floral and mineral components. Broad and viscous on the palate, with intensely honeyed flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade that last a long, long time. Should age virtually forever.",Rauenthaler Nonnenberg Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,94,283.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Georg Breuer
114303,US,"Ultra-soft and a bit hot from high alcohol, this red wine is made in the modern cult style. It tastes of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis and smoky new oak, with a hint of Port.",Ossidiana,87,125.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Viansa
114401,Portugal,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here.

114403,France,"Denser and more minerally than Jaboulet's Les Grandes Terrasses bottling, this is a serious Cornas, brimming with blood and iron notes wrapped in a richly tannic cloak.

114442,Italy,"Bravo Giacomo Neri! This wine raises the bar on modern Brunello and offers a peek view into the future and potential of this incredibly expressive wine. Super concentrated and intense, whiffs of roasted espresso bean, tannery, summer-ripe black cherries, and porcini mushrooms peel back layer after layer. A firmly tannic touch is there to remind you to drink this wine anytime after ten years.

114545,Italy,"Very tense and tight is the nose: It contains precise fruit, baking spice, toasted oak and mint. Wonderfully structured on the palate, which shows bright berry flavors and grainy, grabby tannins. Finishes on the chocolaty side, with length and power. A big boy for sure.",Pecchia,93,155.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,Red Blend,Gagliole
114550,Italy,"A very exciting wine with amazing elegance and linearity that delivers intense aromas of licorice, menthol, toast and pressed blackberry. It boasts a penetrating intensity in terms of its ruby color and in the mouth where firm tannins are followed by lingering freshness on the finish.",Lupicaia,93,140.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Castello del Terriccio
114555,US,"Young and dense, almost misleading in its soft fruitiness, but there's tremendous power, and despite the appearance of approachability, it would be a mistake not to cellar this wine. It's explosive in fruit and berry flavors, and the tannins are so melted, you could easily open it tonight. But this is a wine with proven ageability. Should begin to mature by 2010 and drink well through 2020, at least.",Special Selection,93,136.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
114558,US,"Like Colgin's great Herb Lamb Cabernet, this is 100% varietal, 100% new oak. It's a unique, different sort of Cab, opening with an iodine, Islay Scotch, sea-salt scent that turns surprisingly rich and fruity in the mouth, sweet in chocolate and extraordinarily ripe black currants. This very young wine needs time to show its best. Drink 2009–2015.",Tychson Hill Vineyard,93,250.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Colgin
114565,US,"Tannic and closed to the point of inaccessibility, this Cab-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, comes from low-yielding vines grown 1,700 feet above Knights Valley. It all comes down to a question of ageability. The answer is it will age quite nicely. The balance is superb, and the core of fruit is there. Do not open this wine until 2010; it should continue to develop for another 10 years at least.",Les Pavots,93,150.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Peter Michael Winery
114664,France,"After 30 months in new oak, this needs some time to pull itself together. Right now, it's dominated by oaky notes of vanilla and spice. There does appear to be plenty of old-vine material underneath—you can ferret out hints of apricot and almond skin—so this rating may look stingy in 10 or more years.",Ex Voto,90,175.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,E. Guigal
114679,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses.

114705,Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine.

114714,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",,93,150.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Lucien Le Moine
114812,US,"Made in a very ripe, almost in-your-face style, with flamboyant blackberry pie and cassis flavors veering into rum-soaked raisins and prunes.

114813,US,"Tastes like a fortified Madeira, for good reason. Fermentation was halted with 190.5 proof grape spirits, when sugar level was 9%.

114932,France,"Complex from the first sniff, where it seems herbal, briary and even a bit peppery but simultaneously bacony, spicy and laced with red cherries. On the palate, it's mostly about sous-bois and spice, with just enough cherry fruit for balance. Briary and a bit drying on the finish, but the bet here is that this wine will age superbly.

114933,Australia,"There's just 350 cases produced of this terrific wine, which has light tobaccoey aromas layered over cherry pie.

114955,France,"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish.

115021,Italy,"Despite the heat, this vintage lives up to the Solaia reputation with a slightly more ripe rendition.

115024,South Africa,"91% Cabernet Sauvignon, plus Merlot and Cabernet Franc, Vergelegen's ultrapremium cuvée is tightly structured, harmoniously balanced, and built to age, although it has a greener flavor profile than many modern wines—bell pepper and bramble aromas and green bean flavors—there is still plenty of underlying cassis, tobacco and chocolate to make this a keeper. Polished tannins lead to a long, powerful finish.",V,92,145.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Blend,Vergelegen
115041,US,"This is one of those tiny-production wines that gets tongues buzzing in San Francisco restaurants. The 100% Cab was aged for nearly two years in almost all new French oak. It is rich and flavorful in ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, with tannins co-contributed from the grapes and the barrels that suggest mid-term aging. It's a very fine, New World-style Cab that should be at its best between 2007 and 2010.",,91,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Scarecrow
115160,France,"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.",La Cabotte,96,500.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
115161,France,"As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure.

Age this wine for at least 5 years.",Les Pucelles Premier Cru,96,175.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
115162,France,"A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character.

To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.",,96,500.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet

115166,France,"A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors.

115167,France,"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",,95,600.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
115169,France,"The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood.

Intensely botrytized aromas of dried apricots billow from the glass, accented by hints of toast, vanilla and coconut from aging in new oak barrels. Round and mouthfilling, it is very sweet, but with just enough acid to provide a semblance of balance.

116551,US,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.",Insignia,97,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
116564,US,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.",Backus,95,200.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
116565,US,"Youthful tannins star in this young wine. The wine is dry and balanced, with a fabulous core of blackberry, cassis and smoky oak. With a drop of Petite Verdot, which adds a touch of violets, this is one of the best high mountain Cabs of the vintage. Too dry and toughly astringent to drink before 2010;  should develop well through 2016, at least.",Reserve,95,120.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain
116573,France,"This flagship wine is Laroche's selection from the best wines of Les Blanchots. At this stage, it is young, its aromas mineral and crisp, but its future generous richness is very evident.

116662,Australia,"For a late-release 2002, this is still very youthful, packing layers of rich cassis and blackberry fruit into a soft jacket of vanilla, cedar and toasted coconut. It's full-bodied, lush and velvety—a simply terrific Cabernet that should prove to have excellent aging potential as well. Drink now–2020.",The Benbournie,93,140.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jim Barry
116685,Italy,"This sweet wine from Italy is guaranteed to blow your socks off. Its thickness and density resembles concentrated maple syrup or molasses. It is made with Prugnolo Gentile (Sangiovese) grapes that are air-dried and then aged in small wood containers for many careful years. The gorgeous aromas include roasted chestnuts, brown sugar, prunes and sweet figs and you can sense the power too.",Occhio di Pernice,99,237.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi
116686,France,"A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral.

No doubt for long-term aging.",,98,411.0,Burgundy,Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
116687,France,"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",,98,757.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
116688,US,"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",,97,140.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Continuum
116689,Italy,"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality. The wine is smooth and round with lingering notes of brown sugar, roasted almond, melted sugar, dried apricots and figs.",375ml,97,170.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,White Blend,Avignonesi
116691,Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",Nicasia Vineyard,97,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata

116694,US,"This is an extraordinarily rich and rewarding Cabernet to drink now. Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight. It's flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, red licorice and cola. The alcohol seems high, but that's in the modern style, and there's no denying the sheer lusciousness.",Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard,96,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter
116695,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",La Cabotte,96,660.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
116696,France,"From the largest of the Chablis Grand Cru, this wine shows a lively fruit character but also a powerful, taut mineral streak that comes through to dominate.

116698,France,"From a parcel that used to belong to the Hospices in Chablis until purchased by the Moreau family.

Impressive and for aging.",Clos des Hospices Dans Les Clos Grand Cru,95,110.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
116699,France,"Still very young, this is showing the proper staying power of a powerful wine.

A great success for the vintage.",,95,259.0,Burgundy,Chambertin Clos de Bèze,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
116736,Australia,"From a somewhat difficult vintage, Stephen and Prue Henschke have turned out a wonderful Cab. Eucalyptus, tobacco and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that add a deep undercurrent of cassis. It's a big, thickly textured wine, with a long, berry-inflected finish. Not that tannic, it should nevertheless drink well through at least 2015.",Cyril Henschke,92,100.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Henschke
116758,US,"From a vineyard planted in 1975, this rarest of Ponzi wines has been released in only four vintages since. It's an interesting, seductive wine with a silky entry and a strong citrus streak. Cherry fruit is highlighted with tart acids that taste like peaches and apricots. The wine is seamless and juicy, with beautiful balance and lightly layered notes of herb and chocolate. Give it plenty of time to breathe.",Abetina Vineyard,92,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi
116760,France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",,95,328.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
116762,US,"As rich as Napa Cab gets. Made solidly in the modern style, it's soft, elaborate and flamboyant, suggesting ultraripe blackberry pie, currant, mocha-choca and sweet oak flavors. The all-important tannins are smooth as velvet. Few Cabs are more delicious for drinking now, but longterm prospects are entirely unpredictable.",Coliseum Block,95,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter
116767,Italy,This drop-dead gorgeous Brunello (from Angelo Gaja's estate in Montalcino) boasts the beauty and charm of a vineyard that is blossoming with quality and intensity of fruit.

116774,Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action.

Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.",Argentino,95,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
116777,France,"Big fruit, big tannins and a delicious raspberry jelly feel are found on this complex wine.

116789,US,"Finely crafted and densely structured, this young Cabernet shows the many fine features of a superior Napa Valley wine. It's very dry, and the tannins are thick and firm. They're also quite astringent, with a lockdown mode that makes it hard to appreciate the wine's deep flavors of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate. Should age well. 2012–2018.",,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roy Estate
116900,Australia,"Full-bodied and powerful, this is still quite youthful, powered by Graves-like notes of earth, tobacco and vanilla wrapped around a solid core of cassis.

117080,Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon.

117087,Australia,"One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic.

117143,US,"Il Luce is a new vineyard, adjacent to Abetina and just one acre in size. This young wine shares a similar high acid tang with its much older sibling, reminiscent of fresh orange juice, and the acids are wrapped into tannic, medium dark cherry fruit. Flavors of chocolate and espresso peek out behind the ripe tannins. The Abetina has more subtle depth, but this shares a very similar weight and balance. It promises good things in the future.",Il Luce Vineyard,89,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi

117264,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Son Negre,88,110.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
117275,France,"At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?",Le Méal,94,134.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier

117319,Spain,"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200.

117339,US,"Colgin's first Syrah, and the first from winemaker Mark Aubert, the wine is very dark and glyceriney, suggesting massive extract. Opens with an exciting blast of white pepper leading to baked cherry pie, leather, truffle and complex earthy scents. In the mouth, it's very fruity and chocolaty, with tons of toasty new oak.

117352,Australia,"From the folks who bring you Two Hands comes this big Cab, which sticks to the glass and deals a chile-spiced nose right out of the gate.

117452,Italy,"This is not an in-your-face-wine.

117538,Australia,"Dark garnet-black in color, but as dark as it is, this is not one of those explosive, overextracted types of New World Pinot.

117631,Australia,"Buttery gold in color, with hay and peach flavors and a long, dry, persistent finish. Tasted blind, some mistook this Roussanne—a variety that isn't seen often on its own—for a Chardonnay. Very pretty, with good acidity.",Aeolia,90,100.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Roussanne,Giaconda
117825,France,"The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast.

117843,US,"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic.

117847,France,"Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year.

117855,France,"This new release from Mumm is a selection from 12 of the best vineyards owned or run by the company.

Worth aging for another 4–5 years.",Cuvée R. Lalou Brut,93,140.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm
117870,US,"Few Cabs on earth are riper than this, with its enormous flavors of black currants, cherry-pie filling, plum jam and chocolate that overwhelm the mouth with decadence.

117948,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

119212,France,"Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries.

122244,Portugal,"It has a medicinal character along with flavors of syrup and wood. It is concentrated, almost too concentrated, very intense, to be drunk by the drop rather than the glass.",Very Old White Dry,87,135.0,Port,,,Port,Kopke
122259,US,"This pricey, low production Cab hails from the lower slopes of Spring Mountain, and shares that region's terroir in the hard, firm tannins and stony minerality that undergirds the cassis, cherry and cedar flavors. Very fine in structure, polished and focused, it will blossom this year, and age well for many more.",Cuvée Claire,93,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Cole
122264,US,"This multivineyard blend is from Sonoma Valley and Dry Creek Valley. You really don't want to open it yet because it's too young. But it has a great future ahead, to judge from the rich, softly fine tannins and cherry, red currant, cola, olive tapenade and sweet fresh herb flavors. Balanced and refined, this Cab defines the Sonoma style. Best 2008–2015.",Reserve Speciale,93,100.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
122274,US,"This has a broad impact on the palate, spreading across the tongue with full flavors of berry and plum, cherry and hints of smoke. It's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, pure and concentrated.. As the wine opens in the glass its flavors become more dense, offering cherry compote, bourbon barrel and crème brûlée, annotated with black olive and bouquet garni.",Grand Ciel,93,125.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,DeLille
122354,Chile,"Haven't seen this excellent wine in a couple of vintages, and while the $180 price tag is sky high there's no denying the wine's quality, which centers around cedar and tobacco aromas and fine core fruit. Flavors and aromas of cassis, berry and plum have tobacco and balsamic accents, while the feel is warm and lush but structured.",Viñedo Chadwick,92,180.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
122446,US,"Soft and lush and delicious, with deep, intriguing flavors of red and black berries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate and smoky cedar. A beautifully structured, classically layered wine, but also fairly tannic. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",Proprietary Red Wine,92,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Roy Estate

122452,France,"Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again.",Les Suchots Premier Cru,92,149.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
122521,France,"Appropriately big and burly, full of ripe fruit, rather soft as well as rich. With its yellow fruits, layers of white currants and a powerful wood element, this is a wine that is still knitting together. There is potential here, especially from the underlying acidity. Give it 4–5 years.",,93,120.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
122535,US,"Layered and complex, this 100% Cab unfolds dramatically in the mouth, offering tiers of cherries, blackberries, currants, plums, mocha, cola and licorice. Turns voluptuously sweet midpalate, then firms up and finishes with tannic intensity. Just 100 cases produced. Best 2010–2016.",Three D,93,110.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Salvestrin
122733,France,"A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry. The fruit is relatively subdued, with a juicy character of raspberries, red plum skins and crisp acidity. This is a wine that needs aging to soften those tannins: give it 4–5 years.",Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru,92,145.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
122757,France,"Enticing aromas of pear juice announce a soft, open-textured wine, with ripe pineapple and kiwi along with a pear skin texture. The wine is ready, its fruit and integrated wood open, soft and welcoming.",Bouchères Premier Cru,91,130.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc
122767,US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones. Best after 2013, if you can keep your hands off.",Litton Estate Vineyard,100,100.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
122768,Australia,"This prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives. The tannins are supremely silky, but this graceful, feminine beauty should drink well through at least 2020.",The Relic,98,135.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Standish
122777,Italy,"We are enthusiastically impressed by this gorgeous wine: From the La Morra location in the Barolo region, Gianni Voerzio and his wife Franca have been making wine since 1986 and carry forth a philosophy that relies on both innovation and tradition.

122779,Australia,"If Standish's Relic is the feminine side of Shiraz, this is in a more masculine vein, with slightly coarser tannins and more weight, but still possessing great intensity without any heaviness.

Drink now-2025.",The Standish Single Vineyard,96,135.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Standish
122781,US,"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense. The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs.

122812,Italy,"Here's a standout Sangiovese-based super Tuscan with a very unique peppermint-like characteristic that helps to increase the wine's intensity and delicious overall effect. Beyond that layer of fresh mint are softer aromas of earth, white mineral, talc powder, pencil lead, cherry and spice. The wine has a strong mineral component.",Flaccianello,92,120.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,Sangiovese,Fontodi
122865,US,"Rather tough and tannic now, with a hard astringency that compromises enjoyment. On the other hand, there's a deep core of black currants and dark unsweetened chocolate.

123030,France,"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity.

123060,Italy,"One of the most exciting names in Barolo, with fruit from one of the most celebrated vineyard crus, this vintage of Cannubi Boschis is a real treasure. Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time.",Cannubi Boschis,95,165.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
123065,Spain,"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well.

123072,Australia,"From vines planted more than a century ago, this richly concentrated, voluptuous wine blossoms with time in the glass, revealing aromas of brandied black cherries and dark chocolate.

123076,Italy,"The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice.

Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef.",Le Vigne,94,155.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
123077,US,"There are $15 Cabs that are better to drink now. This is so strong and fruity, so oaky, so tannic, it just overwhelms the palate in its extreme youth. Just massive in blackberries, black currants, coffee, cocoa, dried herbs and 100% new, smoky-sweet French. Ridiculous to open it anytime soon.

123078,Australia,"This compelling wine delivers a tidal wave of chocolate, dark berries, earth and black olive aromas and flavors.

123079,US,"The new Rubicon, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, brings to mind the 2003 and 2004. It doesn't have the sheer force of 2002 or 2005, but it's certainly a classic Rutherford wine, and has a good future. Bone dry, it shows herb-infused flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and smoky sandalwood, and yes, the tannins are dusty.

123087,Spain,"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors.

123093,US,"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve.

123139,US,"So far, 2005 hasn't been a great year for Beringer's Bordeaux-style wines, and the Private Reserve is a disappointment, although it's still a good wine. A bit tough and gritty now, it shows medicinal cherry and currant flavors, and the tannins have an edge of greenness. With its dry, sharp finish, it might develop complexities over the years.",Private Reserve,87,119.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
123157,US,"This new 100% Cab from the esteemed winemaker, Richard Arrowood, is made in the modern, cult style, which is to say it has high alcohol, soft acids and gentle tannins, and has lush, almost decadent flavors.

123232,Australia,"I suspect the Cyril Henschke Cabernets show better after additional bottle age, but on release they are invariably difficult to read. There is no denying the attractive scents of mint, smoke and cassis in the 2004, nor the ripe plum and cassis-driven flavors, but the wine seems tight and reined in on the palate. Try after 2012.",Cyril Henschke,90,110.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Henschke
123330,France,"There is stunning perfume on this archetypal Pinot Noir. The tannins are soft for a Gevrey, but the red fruits are pure, giving a character that is both firm and sensuous.

123346,France,"Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3–4 years.",Les Rugiens Premier Cru,90,125.0,Burgundy,Pommard,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Faiveley
123360,US,"The vineyard is, of course, in Oakville, which makes you wonder why they put the generic Napa Valley on the label. The wine itself, which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and tannic. Flamboyant, too, with deep black currant flavors bathed in 100% new French oak. Feels lavish and important, but young. Better left untouched for 6–8 years.",Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Knights Bridge

123369,Italy,"Here's a boutique winery that has pushed forward over the generations to offer beautiful expressions of Nebbiolo.

123370,Argentina,"Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's “55” offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes. It's a finessed but forceful (read: high-alcohol) Pinot with penetrating black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors, and the finish is long but hot in its youth. Doesn't lack for much of anything.

123376,US,"Not the greatest Backus ever, and not in the league of the 2001 and 2005. More akin to the 2000. But shows the power and superb tannin development of this fine Oakville vineyard. Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's flamboyant in blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with a grip of mineral or graphite.

123378,Spain,"Starts with the scent of beef on the grill, and then folds in black fruit and fine aged cheese.

Drink now through 2012.",La Cueva del Contador,93,103.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
123408,France,"Soft, ripe and balanced, this is already a delicious wine. The grapefruit edge to the fruit gives it considerable freshness, but there are also flavors of white fruits, just leavened by toast. To finish, the acidity just bounces out of the glass.",Premier Cru Bouchères,91,110.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc
123442,France,"Typically Meursault with its fat fruit and texture, this is a wine that doesn't yet quite integrate. The problem is the excessive wood, which dominates the fruit, and gives tense acidity to the wine. It leaves intense spiciness, burnt toast flavors and a bitter, grapefruit flavor on the finish. Maybe in a few years.",Perrières Premier Cru,87,130.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils

123532,US,"The alcohol is a shocking 16%, but the truth is this wine is deliciously drinkable, in a soft, velvety way. Shows decadent flavors of blackberry essence, cherry tart, dark chocolate and cedar, grounded by earthy notes of sage. Very rich and exotic, almost a liqueur.

123665,Australia,"For this reviewer to not notice the alcohol in a wine that weighs in at 16.4% there have to be a lot of other things going on in the glass.

Give the tannins several years to smooth out before drinking.",Masseria,92,110.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Vietti
123683,US,"This is the most expensive of the winery's new Cabs. It's also the fruitiest and most in need of time in the cellar. Right now, it's a candied blast of blackberries and cherries. The tannins are sweet and chunky, and the oak isn't integrated with everything else. It's awkward. But it should develop for a good 6–8 years, maybe even longer. The score reflects its potential.",Tomahawk Vineyard,92,110.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock

124281,Australia,"One of the Hunter Valley's top bottlings, Brokenwood's Graveyard Vineyard is still marked by hints of toasty oak at this young stage in its evolution.

Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025.",Graveyard Vineyard,91,125.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Brokenwood
124284,Australia,"This is one tightly wound Shiraz. There's cedar and spice on the nose, but the plum fruit is balled up inside, needing time to emerge.

124380,Romania,"An elegant, memorable wine with balance and poise. The nose offers red berry, warming spice and a touch of smoke, while on the palate, smooth, dark berry and spice flavors are harmonious and rich. The wine can age but is good now. Pair with a succulent duck dish or pate and cheeses.",Villa Zorilor Prince Matei Gran Riserva,88,100.0,Dealu Mare,,,Merlot,VinArte
124415,France,"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",Les Terres Blanches,89,105.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey
124425,France,"Plenty of wood here, but also an attractive stream of red berry fruits, topped with cherries.

124886,Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.",Treinta y Dos,90,150.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
125164,US,"Not drinkable now or anytime soon, due to the tannins. Scours the mouth with a hard astringency, like the Cabernets of a generation or two ago. There are rich, ripe flavors of blackberries and currants swimming below those depths, as well as lots of sweet, smoky oak.

125175,Australia,"From an ancient vineyard, this full-bodied, slighly dusty-textured Shiraz boasts attractive scents of mixed berries, but also a slightly tarry note. Flavors run in a similar vein, adding in hints of espresso and vanilla, while the finish develops an ever so slightly gritty, bitter note.

125184,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",,90,142.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
125195,Italy,"This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel. Otherwise, you'll get bold tones of tobacco, leather and spice.",,89,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Tenuta di Trinoro
125256,France,"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years.",Cristal Brut,98,289.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer
125257,France,"Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.",Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut,97,275.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger
125258,US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017.",Estate Bottled,96,125.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
125261,US,"Still young, chewy and textural, this stands as a classic Washington 2005 red—lusciously laden with mixed red and black berries, generous and deep; dense and jammy. The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking.",,96,115.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek
125263,France,"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors.

125268,France,"Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts.

125270,France,"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine. It is more open than the great 1996, more generous, giving some mature toast and nut flavors, but still retaining ripe apricots and mulberry. In the Jacquesson style, this is very dry, but its richness keeps it well in balance.",Brut,95,165.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Jacquesson et Fils
125273,US,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries.

125275,France,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma.

Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop.

125565,France,"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass.

125570,France,"One of the grandest single vineyards in Champagne, an immensely steep south-facing hillside that dominates Mareuil-sur-Aÿ.

128191,Italy,"There's more thickness and extraction here thanks to a sophisticated use of oak. You can taste the wood tones in the form of vanilla, tobacco and spice. Overall, this wine exhibits a bold, immediate style that is immensely seductive and tasty.

128197,Portugal,"Named after Doña Antónia Adelaide Ferreira, who created Quinta do Vallado (and many other quintas) in the 19th century, this complex wine comes from a 100-year-old vineyard. Its concentration is immense, tannins solid, but at the same time the black cherry and dark plum flavors float over everything, leaving richness but also freshness. Worth aging for five years.",Adelaide,93,200.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
128198,Italy,"Packaged with an elegant black label and Bruno Rocca's trademark feather, this wine is unlike anything you will taste from Barbaresco. The nose is rich and inviting with tones of cured meat, black pepper, plum, anise and leather. It's a soft, round wine, but remains elegant and restrained at the same time—and it's a true food-friendly wine.",Maria Adelaide,93,136.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Bruno Rocca
128201,Italy,"You'll find elegance and finesse here thanks to the wine's aromas of pencil shaving, black fruit and oak.

The mouthfeel is excellent: intense, complex and refined and it offers layers of spice and black fruit that last a very long time.",Bricco Asili Bricco Asili,93,150.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ceretto
128202,Italy,"An excellent vintage and an excellent cru (Cerequio is one of Barolo's best) join forces here to produce a balanced, elegant wine. Aged hues of garnet and amber are enhanced by ethereal tones of wet earth, licorice, road tar, anise and dried fruit. The aromas are doled out in a measured, controlled fashion and the wine ends with dusty, ash-like notes. It's ready to drink.",Cerequio,93,115.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Contratto
128203,Italy,"This bold wine is dark in color and concentration and offers layers of ripe cherry, blackberry and loads of mineral tones such as graphite and black slate. It's one of the darkest Barolos of the vintage and it ends with thick, drying tannins and crisp acidity. Let it age five years and drink with braised lamb chops.",Fossati,93,103.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cascina Adelaide
128204,Italy,"The Cannubi Boschis cru (also known as Monghisolfo) is known for the excellent quality of its fruit. This expression is particularly austere and elegant and would fit appropriately in a gentleman's smoking room or other such formal context.

128215,Italy,"Poderi Luigi Einaudi hits a home run with its Cannubi-grown Barolo. This is a soft and decadent wine that entices with its natural opulence and sophistication. The aromas include soft vanilla, allspice, white chocolate and coffee. It's smooth and velvety in the mouth with a fine, crisp finish and is almost ready to drink (wait two to five more years).",Cannubi,93,105.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
128216,Italy,"Pajé is a beautiful amphitheater of vines in Barbaresco known for finesse and elegance. This older vintage maintains very good integrity of fruit that is enhanced by layers of black licorice, mineral notes, ash, tobacco and cola. But at the heart of it all is a blast of red cherry. It's a vertical, intense and streamlined wine that is ready to drink now.",Crichët Pajé,93,190.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Roagna
128400,France,"Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits.

128402,France,"Guigal's luxury cuvée from Condrieu is a blend of vineyards, all vinified and agfed for eight months in new oak.

128407,US,"This is a gigantic wine made solidly in the modern cult Napa style of dazzling power. It's similar to the winery's 2005, although lacking some of its structure. Massive in blackberries, black currants and cedar flavors, with a pleasantly earthy edge of green olives and carob. Extremely fine, but wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2012.",Select Private Reserve,93,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marita's Vineyard
128410,Italy,"Fragrant and intense, Bertani's 2003 Amarone delivers enticing aromas of spice, cola, mature berry fruit and smoke.

128416,US,"Massive, high in alcohol, distinctly New World in style, this 100% Syrah impresses for its sheer volume. Explodes on the palate with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise, leather, mocha and peppery spices that sink in deep and last long on the finish. With alcohol approaching 16%, it's a wine you'll either love or hate. Best now and through 2012 for youthful opulence.",IX Estate,93,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Colgin
128418,Germany,"If you're seeking laser-like focus in your eiswein, this is the bottling for you.

128498,Spain,"With Matallana, you must pay for your pleasure. But pleasurable it is. The nose is a splendid blend of licorice, baking spices, cassis and black plum. The approach is neither quiet nor loud, but well-spoken. It pumps forth huge black cherry and plum fruit, but offsets any raw size with tobacco, herb, coffee and other subtleties. A touch hard now but should soften with a couple of years aging. Best from 2010–2013.",Matallana,93,145.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
128501,Spain,"Smoky, dark and alluring is how this modern-leaning Rioja starts out. The nose is meaty and ultraripe, but balanced. And so is the palate, which shows flavors of blackberry, cassis, tobacco, cola and coffee. The finish is cuddly and long, with a splinter of coconut and lots of spice. A “racimo” in Spanish is a bunch, so the name refers to the three or so grape bunches that each vine produces.",Hiru 3 Racimos,93,118.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Cañas
128503,Italy,"Barolo Mosconi drinks young at this stage but already paints a pretty picture of the 2005 vintage. The wine offers direct intensity and layered aromas of luscious chocolate and coffee with loads of spice, leather and tar on the finish. The tannins are still a bit aggressive, so give this wine time to age: Drink after 2018.",Mosconi,93,105.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Conterno Fantino
128506,US,"Dark in youth, and oaky, with 85% new French wood, this Philippe Melka-crafted Cab has the fresh young flavors of an immature Bordeaux. It needs time for the intense currant, blackberry, sandalwood and spice flavors to integrate with the firm tannins.

128512,Italy,"You pay, dearly, for quality, but rest assured you get it with Gaja.

128671,US,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.",Insignia,97,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
128684,US,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.",Backus,95,200.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
128685,US,"Youthful tannins star in this young wine. The wine is dry and balanced, with a fabulous core of blackberry, cassis and smoky oak. With a drop of Petite Verdot, which adds a touch of violets, this is one of the best high mountain Cabs of the vintage.

128720,US,"Here's a Bordeaux blend that aims high and largely succeeds. It's soft and intricate despite the thick tannins, with a mouthfeel like wool.

129047,US,"A very good but not great Cask 23, showing plenty of decadence and flair but not perhaps that extra edge of complexity. It's forward now in sweet new oak and flashy, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The tannins are quite an achievement, rich, vibrant and supple.

129475,Italy,"An intriguing, fabulous dessert wine. The aromas are complex, intense and balanced on a tightrope: mature peach, honey, wet stone, peppermint and delicate mineral nuances. Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar.

130973,US,"Il Luce is a new vineyard, adjacent to Abetina and just one acre in size. This young wine shares a similar high acid tang with its much older sibling, reminiscent of fresh orange juice, and the acids are wrapped into tannic, medium dark cherry fruit.

It promises good things in the future.",Il Luce Vineyard,89,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi

131061,France,"Creamy, fruity aromas already suggest a light, frothy wine. And that's just what this is, fulfilling all the specifications for a rosé.

131130,Spain,"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit.

131167,US,"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary.

131174,US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release.

Should hold for a good ten years.",Leonardini Vineyard,90,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitehall Lane
131512,US,"Drinks very soft and forward and is accessible now, with plenty of upfront cherry pie filling, blackberry jam, cocoa and cola flavors.

131574,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different.

131737,Spain,"Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas.

131869,Spain,"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200.

So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Aurus,94,212.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
136013,France,"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time.",Ex Voto,94,450.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,E. Guigal
136017,Spain,"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,93,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
136018,US,"Practically overflows with lush, ripe fruit—mainly cassis—but that richness is kept in classic balance by the dusty tannins on the finish.

136295,France,"The 2004s at Ogier are tremendously successful, none more so than the family's top cuvée. The 2004 Belle Hélène boasts waves of creamy raspberry fruit framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Long-lasting on the finish, it's already delicious but should develop additional complexity through 2015.",Belle Hélène,93,199.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
136296,France,"A big step up from Jaboulet's La Petite Chapelle, this is on a par with some of Jaboulet's past efforts. It's richly concentrated, yet nuanced, with notes of blood and mineral added to ripe cassis fruit and accented by hints of vanilla and spice. The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time. Drink 2012–2025.",La Chapelle,93,215.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
136306,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136316,France,"Wonderfully floral and spicy on the nose, with hints of anise that add nuance to the layers of raspberry fruit. Stéphane Ogier claims he adores the 2004 vintage, and with wines like this, why shouldn't he? This finishes lush and long, and although already approachable, should age effortlessly through at least 2015.",Lancement,92,180.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
136328,France,"Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,90,106.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pol Roger
136338,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

136344,Australia,"A tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries. In the mouth it's surprisingly elegant, delivering cherry and spice flavors without excessive weight, ending on a slightly tart note. Drink now and over the next 4–5 years.",Australian Old Vine Collection,90,100.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,Gibson's BarossaVale
136520,France,"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.",La Cabotte,96,500.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
136521,France,"As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.",Les Pucelles Premier Cru,96,175.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
136522,France,"A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.",,96,500.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet

Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power.",Marquis de Laguiche,96,596.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
136526,France,"A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness.",,95,228.0,Burgundy,Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet
136527,France,"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",,95,600.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
136529,France,"The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food.",,95,320.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
136594,France,"A cherry-picked blend of six estate parcels, the 2003 Château d'Ampuis fills the gap in the Guigal hierarchy between the largely négoce Brune et Blonde and the single-vineyard bottlings. Aged 38 months in new French oak, there's an understandable layer of vanilla and spice, but also layers of lush berry fruit. Creamy and rich, with a long, surprisingly elegant finish.

136595,France,"In a cool vintage like 2004, Sorrel's parcels in the warmest terroirs of the hill (Le Méal and Les Greffieux) can outperform.

136603,France,"Possessed of a powerful charred, espresso-like character on the nose,   this isn't that fruit expressive at first, but on the palate black olive and black cherry flavors surge forward, framed by layered tannins and showing great persistence. Needs time; try from 2012.",La Landonne,92,129.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Delas Frères
136613,Portugal,"From a single vineyard at Quinta do Crasto, this wine was fermented in open lagars. It is big, perfumed, packed with superripe fruit. It could almost be too much, but the spice, pepper and dense tannins are restrained by an edge of acidity. It promises long-term aging.",Vinha da Ponte,92,125.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Crasto
136800,France,"It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.",Clavoillon Premier Cru,95,113.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
136801,France,"Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.",,95,253.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet
136802,France,"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",,95,250.0,Burgundy,Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
136803,France,"The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope.

136804,France,"This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres.

136805,France,"The pinnacle of the white wines from Roux Père et Fils, this is  properly opulent, gorgeously rich, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors, along with a discrete layer of new wood.

136806,Austria,"Wenzel's top cuvée is frighteningly expensive, but there's no denying the quality. Intensely botrytized aromas of dried apricots billow from the glass, accented by hints of toast, vanilla and coconut from aging in new oak barrels. Round and mouthfilling, it is very sweet, but with just enough acid to provide a semblance of balance. Dried apricot flavors dominate, but there's also superripe apple and melon flavors, while hints of spice and citrus emerge on the long finish. A worthy successor to the 2001.",Saz Ruster Ausbruch,94,120.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Wenzel
136808,France,"Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability.

Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt.

When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids.

137385,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch.

137386,US,"To call this a big Cab would be an understatement. It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak.

You'll get chocolate, espresso and mesquite over the wine's rich and velvety close.",,94,112.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Syrah,Tua Rita
137645,US,"Very dark, dramatic, opulent, but young. Opens with brooding aromas of black currants, cassis and spices, and turns dense in tannins in the mouth.

137646,US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness.

137804,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
137958,France,"This is the show stopper of the range from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrezette. It expresses the most powerful Malbec tannins and superripe fruit, without losing sight of the mineral edge. The fruit of this beautiful wine, while opulent, is poised with fine acidity.",Le Pigeonnier,93,110.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château Lagrézette
137959,Australia,"Verging on impenetrable, this is a dark and intensely concentrated offering. Aromas of asphalt, black olive and tea leaves hint at the complexities yet to emerge, while the richly tannic palate is chewy and drying yet mouthwatering at the same time. Drink 2015–2025.",Piggott Range,93,110.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
138011,France,"Though very ripe, the wine's richness is somewhat hidden by a blast of SO2 until you have given it some good aeration. Then the true nose emerges, and if you like fresh-baked pastries and a creamy style of Champagne, this is your bottle. The fruit is peachy/tropical, and an unusual spice note—wintergreen?—adds some lift through the long finish.",Grand Siècle Brut,91,110.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
138183,Australia,"A blend of 75% Cab, with Cab Franc and Merlot making up the balance in equal parts. Its smooth, claylike texture is just excellent, and the fruit's mochalike accents are quite pretty. Feels warm on both the nose and the palate, though it's only 14.5% alcohol.",Cyril Henschke,90,100.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Henschke
138216,Italy,"Here's a beautifully executed 50-50 blend of Merlot from Avignonesi and Sangiovese from Capannelle with soft layers of cherry and blackberry packed tight between spice, cola and mesquite. The wine imparts a sense of wholeness and fullness thanks to its firm tannins and smoky aftertaste. Pair it with roast pork with wild rice and mushroom cream sauce.",50 & 50,92,105.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Avignonesi-Capannelle
138225,Australia,"Full bodied and plushly textured, this is a rich, heavily oaked wine that successfully marries menthol- and coffee-scented oak with intense raspberry fruit.

Dramatic and lush; drink now-2015.",Lunar Block,92,100.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Kurtz Family
138298,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
138406,France,"Bready and round, and super attractive on the bouquet. Runs a bit crisp in the mouth, with orange and grapefruit flavors.

138489,Australia,"The wine now bears a South Australia appellation because the fruit is coming from Langhorne Creek. This vintage clocks in at 15.5% alcohol, with nutmeg and blackberry aromas.

Optimal enjoyment likely 2008–2010.",Reserve,90,120.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Noon

138526,Italy,"Extremely elegant but also understated, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese needs a few minutes in the glass before it reveals itself fully.

138575,France,"Made from 70–80-year-old estate-grown vines, this boasts a tremendously complex and seductive bouquet of smoke, violets, raspberries and blackberries.

138693,US,"Tough and tannic now, and not yielding much, this 96% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in Mayacamas Mountains vineyards.

138714,US,"Made from selected lots, this is a young, sharp, tannic wine not showing its best now. It doesn't have that sumptuously soft, sexy quality a ready-to-drink Cab shows.

138867,Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration.

138869,Italy,"Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint.

138922,Italy,"Bravo Giacomo Neri! This wine raises the bar on modern Brunello and offers a peek view into the future and potential of this incredibly expressive wine.

139107,US,"Not very pleasant now due to the sharpness and bitterness of the texture, as well as the wood tannins that come from aging in 100% new oak. The flavors are of primary fruit blackberries, cherries and black currants. This is a big wine now lacking in polish, but it should develop in the cellar and begin to acquire bottle bouquet after 2012, continuing to glide through 2018 or so.",Reserve,91,150.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Groth
139119,Australia,"A manageable 14.5% alcohol, Two Hands' flagship Cab has dark aromas with a ribbon of raspberry jam running through them.

139141,US,"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves.

139224,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site.

139502,France,"Complex from the first sniff, where it seems herbal, briary and even a bit peppery but simultaneously bacony, spicy and laced with red cherries.

140045,Italy,"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy.

141355,France,"On first whiff, it shows big fruit and vanilla, but it settles down on the palate to deliver cedary plum- and cassis-flavored fruit. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins. It's bulky and lacks a bit of grace, but it still makes for a satisfying mouthful of Bordeaux that should improve with time. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation.",Kosher,89,100.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pontet-Canet
141390,US,"An excellent wine, and clearly an ager, but I don't think it's in the league of the magnificent '99. It's too young to enjoy now, to judge from the closed, astringent, oaky, tannic mouthfeel. But there's certainly some powerful cassis fruit. Hold until at least 2008. Eventually, it could stun.",Rubicon,90,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Niebaum-Coppola
141550,Italy,"This is a proud, modern Brunello Riserva that delivers strong and decisive oak tones including vanilla bean, toasted espresso, chocolate fudge and sweet spice that cast a shadow over the natural fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and has good harmony in the mouth, although those wood tones are very present here too.

141741,Spain,"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch.

142004,France,"A slight disappointment, but still very good, with honey, smoke, caramel and peaches.

It's unctuous almost beyond the point of being wine—offering a mèlange of dried fruits and honey that ooze over every taste bud, filling the pores of your mouth and then releasing sugar and flavor for minutes afterward.

143527,US,"Some great Cabs are drinkable when young, while others require patience. This is the latter sort. It's a tough, young wine, dominated by dusty tannins leading to an astringent finish. But it's incredibly fine, showing a balance and grace rare even in Napa Valley. As it warms up and breathes in the glass, it gets even better, giving tantalizing hints of ripe cassis and cherries that now are buried.

What a beauty.",Claret,96,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Robert Foley
143533,US,"Stunning. Explodes with the most intricately detailed aromas: a perfume of fine smoky oak and ripe black currants. Exudes sheer power, with great weight yet no heaviness.

143534,US,"More structured than the Melbury, with deeper, firmer tannins: but it's certainly not a tannic, hard wine. It's the quality of the tannins, fine, ripely sweet, intricate. The flavors are enormously rich in blue and black berries, as well as chocolate. Magnificent wine, fleshy, fat, opulent. As delicious as it is now, should age well through 2020.",St. Eden,96,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,BOND
143535,US,"Based on Oakville fruit, Vecina is not quite as fruit-driven as the other two Bond wines. It's a bit backward, with an earthy, mushroomy, soy and balsamic taste alongside the briary berry flavors. Has an almost feral quality that is quite interesting and different.

143544,Germany,"This wine's intense aromas of honey, oranges and tea seem almost a little roasted or caramelized, but on the palate the flavors are brilliantly defined and focused by vibrant acidity that brighten the bold citrus and honey notes.

143546,Italy,"Here is a rock-solid Cabernet embellished by a delicate aromatic embroidery that gives its Piedmont origins away.

It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate.

Soft, ripe and enormously attractive, it seduces the palate with gooey red and black currant, cherry, blueberry, melted Swiss chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that just pile up and up and go on and on.

It all comes down to a question of ageability. The answer is it will age quite nicely. The balance is superb, and the core of fruit is there. Do not open this wine until 2010; it should continue to develop for another 10 years at least.",Les Pavots,93,150.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Peter Michael Winery
143825,Italy,"A standout sparkler, this wine delivers an intense and complex bouquet ripe with peach, pineapple, toasted almond and egg custard. A brilliantly crystalline appearance underscores the acidity and crisp freshness on the palate. The wine's full, textured feel is most impressive.

143849,Hungary,"The sweetest Aszú wine, with 217 grams per liter of sugar (only pure Essencia is sweeter). Honeyed nuts, brown sugar, orange blossom and chocolate aromas waft from the glass. Full and viscous in the mouth, this balanced wine, with a modest 8.5% alcohol, has beautiful flavors of toffee, caramel and orange tea. Finishes long and complex.

143943,US,"Expensive, yes, but this is a wine of very high quality. The Cabernet Sauvignon shines through, showing enormous black currant flavor, and then there are the wonderfully ripe, smooth tannins that make the wine glide like velvet. It seems to be best now, but should hold for some years.",Reserve,93,100.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
143945,France,"Selected from the eight grand cru villages in which Madame owned vineyards, this lean, youthful wine is delicious now but could use additional bottle age to broaden out. Toasty and citrusy, there's a lot of fruit here, yet it retains a great sense of elegance.",La Grande Dame Brut,93,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
143953,France,"Tasted from a magnum disgorged in '97, this provides ample evidence that '85 was a great year for Clicquot. Toasty, but seems less evolved than the '85 Brut, with a deep copper color, meaty, savory aromas, berry flavors and a full, creamy texture. Long on the finish. It's made from the same base as the '85 Brut, but with 14.5% red from Bouzy added.",Brut Rosé,93,250.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
143968,France,"Very clean, young and fresh, with tremendous aging potential. Pineapple and Golden Delicious give it primary, young-fruit flavors that need years to develop. This rating may look stingy in time. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",R.D. Extra Brut,92,200.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
143973,Spain,"Fairly typical of a quality PX, with prune, fudge and leather on the nose. Runs a touch syrupy, but the flavors are excellent: the chocolate, raisin and coffee tastes are all precise and stellar. Shows some raw power at times, but also remains subdued.",Rare Sherry Pedro Ximénez Viejo,91,120.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Osborne
143985,Spain,"A high-water mark for Jean León, which usually sticks to varietal wines. Zemis, on the other hand, is a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc that makes its point. After a tight, bruising, sulfuric beginning, the wine finds its groove, showing black cherry, plum and earth flavors. Thorough and rewarding; a fine red from Penedès.",Zemis,91,126.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Jean León
143997,Spain,"Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks.",Viña El Pisón,90,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Artadi

It's also tasty and sweetly plump, with savory cherry and blackberry flavors. On the light side, but polished and refined.",Melbury,89,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,BOND
144062,US,"Made in a very ripe, almost in-your-face style, with flamboyant blackberry pie and cassis flavors veering into rum-soaked raisins and prunes.

144063,US,"Tastes like a fortified Madeira, for good reason. Fermentation was halted with 190.5 proof grape spirits, when sugar level was 9%.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Mission,Gypsy Canyon

144216,France,"Like the regular Grande Dame, the aim here is finesse. It's softer and more elegant than Clicquot's vintage rosé, with delicate hints of cherry, toast, mushroom and citrus.

144227,US,"This is the most expensive of N&N;'s current Cab lineup and also a remarkably good wine.

144290,Spain,"A compact red with aromatic hints of tobacco, violets and dark berries. Fueled in high-octane fashion, meaning it's tight, tannic and forward. While it needs five years to loosen up, now you get refined black cherry and chocolate. A stern drink for those who favor big reds. Tempranillo with 30% Graciano.",Aro,90,179.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
144301,Italy,"Despite the heat, this vintage lives up to the Solaia reputation with a slightly more ripe rendition.

144304,South Africa,"91% Cabernet Sauvignon, plus Merlot and Cabernet Franc, Vergelegen's ultrapremium cuvée is tightly structured, harmoniously balanced, and built to age, although it has a greener flavor profile than many modern wines—bell pepper and bramble aromas and green bean flavors—there is still plenty of underlying cassis, tobacco and chocolate to make this a keeper. Polished tannins lead to a long, powerful finish.",V,92,145.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Blend,Vergelegen
144321,US,"This is one of those tiny-production wines that gets tongues buzzing in San Francisco restaurants. The 100% Cab was aged for nearly two years in almost all new French oak. It is rich and flavorful in ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, with tannins co-contributed from the grapes and the barrels that suggest mid-term aging. It's a very fine, New World-style Cab that should be at its best between 2007 and 2010.",,91,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Scarecrow
144424,US,"Tannins and acids currently dominate, giving this dry, young wine a bit of a lockdown quality. The winemaker, Michael Trujillo, aims at a more structured style, and he has achieved it here. There's a deep heart of cherries and blackberries, with sweeter oaky notes. This is a wine to lay down for six years or longer.",Semper V Meritage,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sequoia Grove
144500,Italy,"Deep and delicious, with an earth-driven nose that conveys quality. Chunky plum pervades the chewy, dark palate, which offers a gorgeous mouthfeel and admirable depth. Only on the finish do you get a slight hint of oak. Overall it's entirely solid and very likable, but as good as it is, it's not quite on the level of the '98 or '99, which were amazing.",Ornellaia,94,145.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia
144504,Italy,"Incredibly pure fruit defines the sturdy, entirely inviting nose. This is one juicy, rock steady wine; the tannic structure is that of a fortress. There's unadulterated fruit at every checkpoint, and it hits like a hammer as it transitions from palate to finish. To drink now would require rich, rich food. It's such a baby; drink not before 2007, if possible.",Riserva,94,100.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fuligni
144507,US,"Gorgeous, beautiful wine, so strongly delicious on its own that it will be a challenge to pair it with food. A myriad of flavors cascades over the palate: cassis, blackcurrants, black cherries, white chocolate, spiced plums and dried herbs. So rich and decadently ripe, it's almost a dessert wine. The tannins are completely soft and melted.",,93,100.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hartwell
144508,Italy,"Despite a veneer of toasty French oak, this wine shines with complex layers of fruit. Black cherries lead the way, accented by hints of bacon, dried herbs and spices.

144542,Spain,"With density and purity, this is yet another fine Rioja from 2001.

144609,Italy,"It's almost criminal to taste Sassicaia before its prime. The 2003 vintage should be ready after 2010.

144655,Italy,"Already complex, this cru Barolo from Ceretto is packed with exotic aromas and flavors that range from pipe tobacco, cedar and cherries to tar, earth and mushrooms.

144782,Italy,"Rock solid and compact. This wine is true-blue Brunello, meant to be cellared for 10 or more years. Flavors of plum, cherry and currant are pure, and there's far more fruit here than wood. But the tannins are like nails and they get harder and harder with each sip. Yes, it's a top-flight Brunello, but hold, for best results, until 2010.",Poggio all'Oro Riserva,93,125.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Castello Banfi
144806,US,"Oak dominates in the wine's youth, with scents of wood and smoky earth. In the mouth, rich and dense. The tannins are thick, but soft and melted. Acidity kicks in on the finish.

No doubt meant for the cellar.",Reserve,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
144820,France,"Onion-skin color leads to a wine that is packed with deep fruit flavors. Considerably dry but a great food wine, with good acidity and ability to age well in bottle.

144869,US,"Classic Napa Cab, right up there with the greats. Somehow manages to combine monstrous power with understated elegance. The strength is obviously in the ripe fruit and elaborate oak, while the subtlety lies in the soft tannins and impeccable balance.

145147,France,"The Bessards vineyard is right at the heart of the Hermitage hill. Delas only makes this wine in top years (no 2002, for example), and the quality shows in the aromas of black fruits and violets, the flavors of huge, dense fruit and powerful tannins. This is serious wine, which promises at least 10 years of aging.",Les Bessards,93,122.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
145148,US,"This is a big wine for folks who like to age their Cabs.

145153,US,"This is certainly a wine to lay down. It has a marvelous core of blackcurrant and cherry fruit, and the oak is sweet, but the grip hits mid-palate, and the tannins close everything down on the finish. Will marry well with a rich steak, but should age effortlessly for many years. Now through 2015.",S.L.V.,93,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
145260,Italy,"Not the best vintage  for Sassicaia enthusiasts or collectors, but certainly noteworthy thanks to defined herbal aromas such as rosemary and sage backed by black plum, black berry, tobacco, cigar box and leather.

145266,US,"Huge wine, young and tannic, almost bitter now and not offering much relief. But of course you don't buy Beringer PR tonight. There is indeed enormous Cabernet flavor deep down inside, offering oodles of blackberries and cherries and charry new oak, but there's also a warning note of prune. Best after 2008.",Private Reserve,90,116.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145272,Italy,"Tenuta Sette Ponti's internationally styled blend is heavy and dense, a mirror image of the hot '03 vintage. Thus it pours on the blackberry, plum and fudge flavors with gusto. This is a seriously fat, opulent red that would weigh in as a heavyweight at any wrestling match. Still, it's delicious and quite balanced. Drink from 2007 through 2009.",Oreno,90,100.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Sette Ponti
145380,US,"Another huge '99. It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish. There is a core of blackberry fruit that is solid and dense, the result of very low yields. This pricy wine is not drinkable now, unless you're not fussy. If you buy it, plan on aging for at least five years.",Reserve,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harrison
145395,US,"Showcases the shortcomings of the vintage as well as the strengths of its terroir and winemaking.

A charming wine meant for early drinking.",Rubicon,90,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Red Blend,Niebaum-Coppola
145396,US,"Richer and more complete than the '98 La Joie, with which it was simultaneously released. This wine shows its mountain origins in its tough young tannins and hard edges, but there is enough cherry and blackberry fruit for the long haul.

145569,US,"Concentrated in cassis, cherry, plum, chocolate and new oak flavors, this is a young Cabernet, currently showing vibrant tannins and acidity.

145674,US,"The lovely bouquet of blackberry jam, oak with mint, cedar, and black olives draws you in. Broad and rich on the palate, with ample but fine tannins. Great depth of dark-berry fruit, with coffee and cedar shadings. The explosive finish just keeps going as intriguing sweet-tart fruit and bitter chocolate notes please all the way out. Best to hold six to nine years.",,95,125.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale
145676,US,"Opens with aromas of black cherry and pencil lead, fruitcake and cookie dough; now it's all one big melange wrapped a bit tight. The balance and immense depth of fruit shine, even in this unevolved state. Standard dark-plum and chocolate notes are rendered with uncommon subtlety here. The finish goes on and on. Needs four to six years, but will last and last.",Insignia,95,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
145881,Italy,"Potent and alive, kind of rubbery and leathery, with a shot of barnyard thrown in for good measure. Shows solid cherry and berry at the core, but that fruit is offset by hard tannins and overt firmness. Not a lush, modern playboy; more of classic with old-world appeal. Needs time in the glass to unravel.",Sammarco,89,116.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese,Castello dei Rampolla
145888,Italy,"Zesty and woody at first, but later balsamic notes blend with jammier aromas to create a solid but oak-influenced bouquet.

But very expensive or what you get.",Camartina,88,104.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Agricola Querciabella
145952,US,"A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding. The chewy finish is lengthy and elegant, and it should be held for no less than five years. This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet.",Georges de Latour Private Reserve,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
145954,US,"Simply a spectacular wine; a Napa prototype for fabulous Cabernet. Cassis, tobacco and cedar commingle on the nose, followed by luscious cassis fruit that's backed up by exemplary barrel notes—both in flavor and in texture. So smooth and deft, it's the epitome of class. Give it about five years in the cellar and then indulge.",Reserve,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harrison
145958,US,"Starts off with a classy bouquet of blackberry liqueur, coffee and nicely integrated oak. The fruit is very dense—almost overripe—but still delicious, with prune, dark chocolate and cocoa.

Interesting, almost atypical in some ways, but harmonious and complete.",Reserve,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andrus
145961,US,"Full-priced, full-bodied, and the full complement of just about all you want in a Rutherford Cab.

145965,US,"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound.

146047,US,"Starts with that telltale pedigree aroma of perfectly ripe blackcurrant and cassis complexed with fine smoky oak.

Drink now.",Morisoli Vineyard,90,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Galleron
146059,France,"From a single parcel, situated just south of Condrieu, this wine takes its name from the fact the vineyard has an almost vertical slope, with a full south exposure.

146162,Italy,"Kendall-Jackson's super Tuscan is Cab-based and very ripe. It's black as coal, with leather, earth and dark-fruit aromas.

146180,France,"This is tough as nails right now, but also packed with almost liqueur-like black cherry fruit. Meaty nuances and chocolate-fudge richness are stopped abruptly by firm, astringent tannins on the finish.

146255,US,"Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak.

146258,US,"Cassis liqueur, blueberry notes and a smoky cured-meat element comprise the nose of this engaging, beautifully balanced offering. Dried cherry, cedar, tea and tobacco flavors predominate, and the texture is supple. The long finish displays handsome cherry and coffee notes, with plentiful but even tannins.

146514,US,"Extremely dark, with toast, cherry liqueur and forest notes on the nose; this opens into deep black fruit, licorice and espresso flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich, as it transitions effortlessly into a smooth, dry, anise and briar-tinged finish that has an interesting and elegant viscosity to it. A black beauty needing three to five years to develop.",Non Plus Ultra,90,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paoletti
146606,US,"Flashy oak and deep, pure blackcurrants show from the first whiff, and the purple color stains the sides of the glass in this wine with enough glycerine to float the Sixth Fleet. Doesn't disappoint on the palate, with ripe blackberry flavors and gorgeous, velvety tannins. Closes long, with a sweet, richly-fruited finish. Cellar Selection.",,95,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakford
146657,US,"Yes, that is the correct price. This Applegate Valley Zin might be considered the Turley of Oregon. The bottle alone must weigh several pounds. Concentrated raspberry and boysenberry fruit retains enough acid to keep it from becoming syrupy. The  supremely oaky flavors carry streaks of Kahlua and dark chocolate. But the density that might balance the 16.5% percent alcohol just isn't there.",Estate Reserve,87,100.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Southern Oregon,Zinfandel,Troon
146719,US,"Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components.",,90,120.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kathryn Kennedy
146766,Germany,"Simply gorgeous aromas of honey, apricots and tangerines are echoed on the palate, where the wine is full, rich and sweet without seeming overly heavy. The moderate levels of acidity provide adequate balance now, but may prove too low for extended aging; that's okay, because it's so good now. Probably best over the next 5–10 years.",Hochheimer Domdechaney Beerenauslese,92,126.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
146767,Germany,"Similar in aromatics and flavor to Werner's slightly less weighty BA, the TBA features musky scents reminiscent of tropical flowers as well as tremendous weight and texture. Molasses and caramel notes reverberate on the long finish.",Hochheimer Domdechaney Trockenbeerenauslese,91,227.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
146788,Germany,"Vanilla and crème brûlée aromas add complexity to intensely sweet orange-marmalade and apricot aromas and flavors. Focused, with good balancing acidity that leaves a clean citrusy finish.",Hochheimer Kirchenstück Eiswein,89,126.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
146854,US,"The grapes are from the estate in Yountville, just south of Oakville, and young Dominus always seems tight and austere. So it is here. Astringent tannins, youthful acids and new oak are upfront, raising the question of ageability. It's a roll of the dice. The wine is balanced and harmonious, but aggressive now.",,87,109.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dominus
146872,Germany,"A bit of a disappointment after the stellar 2004 auslese, Vollrads's BA is thick and syrupy, but also has a slightly acetic edge to its aromas and flavors. Dried fruit and honey marry with melon notes that tail off a bit on the finish.",Beerenauslese,87,170.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Vollrads
146897,Hungary,"Meaning “honey pot,” Mézes Mály is an esteemed south-facing, first-growth vineyard. This wine has an oxidized character resulting in nutty aromas and cheese-rind flavors. Still, this wine also showed flavors of dried apricot and raisin, although none of the namesake honey. Finishes long, but the oxidative note was still a strike against this wine. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",Mézes Mály Aszú 6 Puttonyos,88,115.0,Tokaji,,,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji
147120,US,"A proprietary blend that tends to a sweet caramel-cinnamon and baked-apple aromatic and flavor profile. Cola, prune and herb elements define the flavor palate, and the feel is very smooth, even lithe. Sweet black fruits, espresso and caramel flavors play on the long finish. Unusual and appealing, but just a bit shy of the stuffing sought here.",M. Coz,88,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,M. Cosentino
147126,US,"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium.",Olive Hill Estate Vyds Special,88,100.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
148047,US,"The most complete and compelling of Diamond Creek's trio of '02s, combining the opulent accessibility of Gravelly Meadow with the power and authority of Volcanic Hill. The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete. Decant now if you must drink it, but it should start to mellow by 2008, and then peak and hold through 2015 at least.",Red Rock Terrace,97,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
148049,US,"Starts off as a closed, tight wine, aromatically speaking, and needs plenty of decanting to breathe, but once it starts to open, there's an eruption of the most refined cassis and cedar aromas. In the mouth, this is an immense Cabernet, profoundly deep in blackberry, roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. It is also enormously tannic, and is effectively locked down. Nowhere near ready, although decanting will help it, but it's best to hold this magnificent wine until 2007, when it should start to open, and then for at least 10 additional years.",Volcanic Hill,95,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
148170,Portugal,"A superb wine, elegance and weight combined magisterially. It has all the right mature flavors, ripe fruit, intense marmalade and concentration. This is a wine with a great reputation, and the taste doesn't let that reputation down. Imported by Kobrand.",40-year old tawny,95,154.0,Port,,,Port,Taylor Fladgate
148174,US,"Last year's bottling was elegant and refined. This year, the Merlot-Cabernet Franc blend remains an extremely elegant wine, yet is even richer in chocolate-cherry flavor, drizzled with vanilla and cinnamon, and wickedly soft on the palate. Somehow, all this richness manages to stay dry.",Red Wine,94,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Amuse Bouche
148175,US,"The fruity intensity of this young Cabernet is impressive, an explosion of cassis and cocoa flavor that dominates the palate. Beyond that is the overall balance. The tannins are sturdy, with good, clean acidity, and the finish is exceptionally long and rich. This classic mountain Napa Cabernet is tough now, and should slowly soften over the next 15 years.",Rattlesnake Hill,94,110.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
148179,Portugal,"This is a sweet but deliciously mature wine that exudes the richness of its burnt orange flavors, layers of sweet toffee, and clean, hugely rich aftertaste. A great wine. Imported by William Grant & Sons, Inc.",40-year old tawny,94,125.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Noval
148181,Portugal,"An old, mature wine, but one that has kept its ripeness and richness. The concentration is so intense that one glass is almost enough (except it tastes so good). There are walnuts, bitter chocolate and a delicious clean aftertaste. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc.",40-year old tawny,94,152.0,Port,,,Port,W. & J. Graham's
148182,US,"Tremendous aromatics on this young wine: a blast of refined cassis, cedar, pine cone, green olives and even roasted meat. Rich and forward in ripe fruit character, and the bigtime tannins are polished. This is an excellent but very young wine. Should peak in 5–7 years.",Gravelly Meadow,93,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
148184,Portugal,"At first taste, this appears amazingly fresh for a 40-year-old, but then the older flavors kick in. There is concentration, ripeness and huge intensity of flavor. It's a beautiful wine, with dried apricots giving freshness. Imported by Pernod Ricard.",40-year old tawny,93,135.0,Port,,,Port,Sandeman
148186,US,"This supple Cabernet feels gentle and soft on entry, then stuns with hidden power and depth. Fully ripe, with chocolaty cassis and cherry flavors. Marked by firm tannins, it is generous now, yet should hold for a good 10 years.",,93,115.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hourglass
148192,Portugal,"A dark, concentrated wine, very impressive. But with all this concentration, there is also sweet fruit, flavors of apricots that have been bottled in spirits. This is a lovely wine, with just a hint of mature, medicinal character. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc.",40-year old tawny,93,148.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
148385,US,"The wine, which is based on Cab Sauvignon, comes from 13 Napa appellations, hence the name. The wine is distinguished, showing lots of lush, forward cassis and cocoa flavor. Has the smoothness of a great old Cognac. Drink now–2013.",Meritage,92,115.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Thirteen
148387,Portugal,"This impressively concentrated wine has classic burnt caramel aromas, with dense, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. It is rich, delicious and tastes somewhat older than its 30-year label.",30-year old tawny,92,174.0,Port,,,Port,Niepoort
148480,Australia,"A steak lover's Cab made in an old-school style, sturdy but not brash. Has its share of oak, to be sure, but it's the “dry tannins and black pepper flavors” kind, not the toast-and-nut route. Red plum and cherry fruit are at its firm core. Enjoyable and traditional. Imported by Pan Pacific Wines.",Grand Reserve,91,100.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pepper Tree
148575,Portugal,"This is a finely balanced, rich but elegant wine, from a company owned by Sogrape, Portugal's largest wine producer. There is some good burnt caramel flavor, as well as ripe fruit, and a delicious, just lightly fresh aftertaste.",30 Year Old Tawny,90,108.0,Port,,,Port,Offley
148678,Portugal,"Dry, with some burnt character, this 40-year old from one of the companies owned by Barros also has great sweet fruit, lime marmalade and layers of acidity. It's well in balance, leaving acidity to finish. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",40-year old tawny,89,150.0,Port,,,Port,Feist
148763,Portugal,"While this wine certainly tastes old, it has a delicious golden glow from the richness of the apricot jelly-flavored ripe fruit. There is just a touch of spirit, but this adds to the warmth. Imported by Jack Poust & Co., Inc.",Presidential 40-year old tawny,89,100.0,Port,,,Port,C. da Silva
148844,Portugal,"An intensely sweet wine, with mature fruit that shows some richness and orange marmalade flavors. It is spoiled by a hint of volatility, which leaves a sharp aftertaste. Imported by Admiral Imports.",40-year old tawny,88,128.0,Port,,,Port,Royal Oporto
148851,Portugal,"A very sweet rich wine, in the Fonseca house style. But it lacks the intensity, going more for sweet almonds, along with some bitter marmalade, and a young taste. Imported by Kobrand.",40-year old tawny,88,157.0,Port,,,Port,Fonseca
148921,Portugal,"Apart from the fact that this tastes too fresh to be a 30-year-old, this is a delicious wine, with ripe, sweet fruits, caramel and just the right layer of dryness.",30-year old tawny,88,115.0,Port,,,Port,Taylor Fladgate
149032,Portugal,"A fine, sweet, fresh wine, which tastes younger than 30 years. The flavors are ripe, layering milk chocolate with acidity in good balance.",30-year old tawny,87,122.0,Port,,,Port,Kopke
149117,US,"From St. Helena. Ultrasoft and ultraripe in the modern style, a cassis and chocolate- flavored wine marked by melted tannins and a soft texture. The wine is voluptuous and very good, but would benefit from better structure.",Moose Valley Estate,87,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,D.R. Stephens
149172,France,"This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,97,345.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild
149173,France,"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,96,360.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux
149174,France,"Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,95,165.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Montrose
149175,France,"Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant. There are generous tannins, ripe black currant fruits, balancing acidity, all in an ensemble that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,95,115.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton
149176,France,"With its aromas of new wood, spice and black fruits, this promises from the start to be a powerful, polished wine. It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estèphe. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,95,150.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cos d'Estournel
149179,France,"With its usual high proportion of Merlot, Palmer 2003 was always going to be a generous, very ripe wine. And so it is proving, but what is so satisfying about the wine at this stage is that the great sweet fruit, which comes right out of the glass. Underneath, of course, there are tannins, so this wine could be drunk soon, and then aged for another 15 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,94,120.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Palmer
149180,France,"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,94,142.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande
149187,France,"This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,94,260.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild
149240,Spain,"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy. Cumin and cinnamon show on the palate and the refined finish is lovely, with anise and white pepper accents.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,94,185.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149247,Spain,"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents. Anise accents the ultrasmooth palate. Full of complex flavors, with a lingering finish.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,125.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino

149471,France,"This is a solid, powerful wine packed with tannins and heavy black fruits. As so often, Ducru is taking its time, and this wine is still knitting itself together. But in future years, watch for the generosity, the richness as well as the finesse and freshness.

149574,New Zealand,"Much like the Bilancia La Collina, also crafted by winemaker Warren Gibson, there's a touch of stone-fruit character to this wine, along with plenty of black- and blueberry fruit. Rich, intense and tannic, this needs time to show additional complexity. Hold 3–5 years. Imported by Davies & Co.",Homage,90,100.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Trinity Hill
149892,US,"I liked the winery's 2001, although it was quite tannic, but this isn't in the same league. This vintage is also numbingly tannic, maybe even more so, but the core of fruit that charmed a year ago isn't there, leading to questions about ageability. If you're a gambler, cellar it for six years and see what's up.",,88,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Palmaz
150562,Australia,"As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.",Grange,96,185.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150762,US,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",Private Reserve,95,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
